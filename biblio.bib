  abstract        = {Proteins that associate with microtubules (MTs) are crucial to generate MT arrays and establish different cellular architectures. One example is PRC1 (protein regulator of cytokinesis 1), which cross-links antiparallel MTs and is essential for the completion of mitosis and cytokinesis. Here we describe a 4-{\AA}-resolution cryo-EM structure of monomeric PRC1 bound to MTs. Residues in the spectrin domain of PRC1 contacting the MT are highly conserved and interact with the same pocket recognized by kinesin. We additionally found that PRC1 promotes MT assembly even in the presence of the MT stabilizer taxol. Interestingly, the angle of the spectrin domain on the MT surface corresponds to the previously observed cross-bridge angle between MTs cross-linked by full-length, dimeric PRC1. This finding, together with molecular dynamic simulations describing the intrinsic flexibility of PRC1, suggests that the MT-spectrin domain interface determines the geometry of the MT arrays cross-linked by PRC1.},

  abstract = {TAXOL (Fig. 1) was isolated from the plant Taxus brevifolia (western yew) by Wani et al., who reported that the molecule has antitumour activity in several experimental systems1. In our laboratory we have found that taxol, a low molecular weight neutral compound, completely inhibits division of exponentially growing HeLa cells at low concentrations of drug (0.25 µM) that have no significant effects on DNA, RNA or protein synthesis during a 4-h incubation with the cells. HeLa cells incubated with taxol for 20 h are blocked in late G2 and/or M (ref. 2). We report here that taxol acts as a promoter of calf brain microtubule assembly in vitro, in contrast to plant products such as colchicine and podophyllotoxin, which inhibit assembly. Taxol decreases the lag time for microtubule assembly and shifts the equilibrium for assembly in favour of the microtubule, thereby decreasing the critical concentration of tubulin required for assembly. Microtubules polymerised in the presence of taxol are resistant to depolymerisation by cold (4 °C) and CaCl2 (4 mM).},

  abstract  = {In most animals, female meiotic spindles are assembled in the absence of centrosomes. How microtubules (MTs) are organized into acentrosomal meiotic spindles is poorly understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, assembly of female meiotic spindles requires MEI-1 and MEI-2, which constitute the microtubule-severing AAA+ ATPase Katanin. However, the role of MEI-2 is not known and whether MT severing is required for meiotic spindle assembly is unclear. Here, we show that the essential role of MEI-2 is to confer MT binding to Katanin, which in turn stimulates the ATPase activity of MEI-1, leading to MT severing. To test directly the contribution of MT severing to meiotic spindle assembly, we engineered Katanin variants that retained MT binding and MT bundling activities but that were inactive for MT severing. In vivo analysis of these variants showed disorganized microtubules that lacked focused spindle poles reminiscent of the Katanin loss-of-function phenotype, demonstrating that the MT-severing activity is essential for meiotic spindle assembly in C. elegans. Overall, our results reveal the essential role of MEI-2 and provide the first direct evidence supporting an essential role of MT severing in meiotic spindle assembly in C. elegans.},

  abstract  = {Assembly of Caenorhabditis elegans female meiotic spindles requires both MEI-1 and MEI-2 subunits of the microtubule-severing ATPase katanin. Strong loss-of-function mutants assemble apolar intersecting microtubule arrays, whereas weaker mutants assemble bipolar meiotic spindles that are longer than wild type. To determine whether katanin is also required for spindle maintenance, we monitored metaphase I spindles after a fast-acting mei-1(ts) mutant was shifted to a nonpermissive temperature. Within 4 min of temperature shift, bivalents moved off the metaphase plate, and microtubule bundles within the spindle lengthened and developed a high degree of curvature. Spindles eventually lost bipolar structure. Immunofluorescence of embryos fixed at increasing temperature indicated that MEI-1 was lost from spindle microtubules before loss of ASPM-1, indicating that MEI-1 and ASPM-1 act independently at spindle poles. We quantified the microtubule-severing activity of purified MEI-1/MEI-2 complexes corresponding to six different point mutations and found a linear relationship between microtubule disassembly rate and meiotic spindle length. Previous work showed that katanin is required for severing at points where two microtubules intersect in vivo. We show that purified MEI-1/MEI-2 complexes preferentially sever at intersections between two microtubules and directly bundle microtubules in vitro. These activities could promote parallel/antiparallel microtubule organization in meiotic spindles.},

Because of a lack of known 3D structures for these enzymes, their mechanism of action has remained poorly understood. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the monomeric AAA katanin module from Caenorhabditis elegans and cryo-EM reconstructions of the hexamer in two conformations. The structures reveal an unexpected asymmetric arrangement of the AAA domains mediated by structural elements unique to microtubule-severing enzymes and critical for their function. The reconstructions show that katanin cycles between open spiral and closed ring conformations, depending on the ATP occupancy of a gating protomer that tenses or relaxes interprotomer interfaces. Cycling of the hexamer between these conformations would provide the power stroke for microtubule severing.},

In humans, tau is one of the major components of the pathognomonic neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s disease brain. Screening of a cDNA library prepared from bovine brain led to the isolation of several cDNA clones encoding tau proteins with different N termini and differing by insertions or deletions, suggesting differential splicing of the tau transcripts. One of the N-terminal domains and the repeated C-terminal domain of the encoded tau proteins are recognized by polyclonal antibodies to bovine tau. The bovine tau proteins are highly homologous to murine and human tau, especially within the repeated C-terminal domain. Compared with murine and human tau, bovine tau contains the insertion of three longer segments, one of which is an additional characteristic repeat. Portions of tau proteins generated by in vitro translation were used to show that these repeats represent tubulin-binding domains, two of which are sufficient to bind to microtubules assembled from purified tubulin in the presence of taxol.},

  abstract = {Microtubule-associated proteins (MAP), such as tau, modulate the extent and rate of microtubule assembly and play an essential role in morphogenetic processes, such as axonal growth. We have examined the mechanism by which tau affects microtubule polymerization by examining the kinetics of microtubule assembly and disassembly through direct observation of microtubules using dark-field microscopy. Tau increases the rate of polymerization, decreases the rate of transit into the shrinking phase (catastrophe), and inhibits the rate of depolymerization. Tau strongly suppresses the catastrophe rate, and its ability to do so is independent of its ability to increase the elongation rate. Thus, tau generates a partially stable but still dynamic state in microtubules. This state is perturbed by phosphorylation by MAP2 kinase, which affects all three activities by lowering the affinity of tau for the microtubule lattice.},

  abstract = {Conventional kinesin is a motor protein that moves stepwise along microtubules carrying membrane-bound organelles toward the periphery of cells. The steps are of amplitude 8.1 nm, the distance between adjacent tubulin binding sites, and are powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. We have asked: how many steps does kinesin take for each molecule of ATP that it hydrolyzes? To answer this question, the motility and ATP hydrolysis of recombinant, heterotetrameric and homodimeric conventional Drosophila kinesins adsorbed to 200-nm-diameter casein-coated silica beads were assayed under identical, single-molecule conditions. Division of the speed by the maximum microtubule-activated ATPase rate gave a stoichiometry of 1.08 ± 0.09 steps for each ATP hydrolyzed at 1 mmATP. Therefore, under low loads in which the drag force ≪ 1 pN, coupling between the chemical and mechanical cycles of kinesin is tight, consistent with conventional power stroke models. Our results rule out models that require two or more ATPs/step, such as some thermal ratchet models, or that propose multiple steps powered by single ATPs.},

  abstract = { Molecular protein motors play key roles in processes such as intracellular cargo transport and brain wiring, and failure of function can give rise to serious diseases. Kinesin-1, a member of the kinesin superfamily (also known as KIFs) is a two-headed motor protein that uses energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to transport diverse types of intracellular cargo toward the plus-ends of microtubules within axons. Recent studies at the level of a single molecule have provided extensive knowledge on how kinesin-1 moves along microtubules. Further elucidation of kinesin-1 movement may shed light on its influence on axon generation, thereby leading to therapies for diseases such as spastic paraplegia type 10 (SPG10), the subject of this review. SPG10 is an autosomal dominant form of hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by mutations in KIF5A, which encodes one of the isoforms of kinesin-1 (KIF5A, KIF5B, and KIF5C). Although little is known about the cargo of KIF5A, a recent study revealed an axonal transport defect of mitochondria in a KIF5A−/− mouse model. This review discusses the consensus moving model of kinesin-1 and the pathogenicity of SPG10 caused by defective KIF5A function. },

  abstract = {Summary
              The kinesin-8 family of microtubule motors plays a critical role in microtubule length control in cells. These motors have complex effects on microtubule dynamics: they destabilize growing microtubules yet stabilize shrinking microtubules. The budding yeast kinesin-8, Kip3, accumulates on plus ends of growing but not shrinking microtubules. Here we identify an essential role of the tail domain of Kip3 in mediating both its destabilizing and its stabilizing activities. The Kip3 tail promotes Kip3's accumulation at the plus ends and facilitates the destabilizing effect of Kip3. However, the Kip3 tail also inhibits microtubule shrinkage and is required for promoting microtubule rescue by Kip3. These effects of the tail domain are likely to be mediated by the tubulin- and microtubule-binding activities that we describe. We propose a concentration-dependent model for the coordination of the destabilizing and stabilizing activities of Kip3 and discuss its relevance to cellular microtubule organization.},

Alternative tubulin isotypes and a variety of post-translational modifications control the properties and functions of the microtubule cytoskeleton, a concept known as the ‘tubulin code'. Here we review the current understanding of the molecular components of the tubulin code and how they impact microtubule properties and functions. We discuss how tubulin isotypes and post-translational modifications control microtubule behaviour at the molecular level and how this translates into physiological functions at the cellular and organism levels. We then go on to show how fine-tuning of microtubule function by some tubulin modifications can affect homeostasis and how perturbation of this fine-tuning can lead to a range of dysfunctions, many of which are linked to human disease.},

This behavior is driven by GTP hydrolysis in the microtubule lattice and is inhibited by anticancer agents like Taxol. We provide insight into the mechanism of dynamic instability, based on high-resolution cryo-EM structures (4.7–5.6 {\AA}) of dynamic microtubules and microtubules stabilized by GMPCPP or Taxol. We infer that hydrolysis leads to a compaction around the E-site nucleotide at longitudinal interfaces, as well as movement of the $\alpha$-tubulin intermediate domain and H7 helix. Displacement of the C-terminal helices in both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-tubulin subunits suggests an effect on interactions with binding partners that contact this region. Taxol inhibits most of these conformational changes, allosterically inducing a GMPCPP-like state. Lateral interactions are similar in all conditions we examined, suggesting that microtubule lattice stability is primarily modulated at longitudinal interfaces.},

               This chapter presents a collection of the various different ways by which tubulins are modified to generate probes for investigating microtubule (MT) dynamics in vitro and in vivo. Labeling with biotin and various fluorochromes is described, as well as the preparation of N-ethylmaleimide tubulin, which has been used to block minus-end growth in vitro. The use of GTP analogs to prepare stable labeled microtubules has proved very useful in a number of different experiments. The tubulin used in the presented methods was prepared from bovine brain by two cycles of temperature-dependent polymerization, followed by phosphocellulose chromatography. The cycling procedure described in the chapter selects active subunits and removes free nucleotide. This produces a tubulin preparation suitable for use in in vitro assays. The standard biotin-labeled tubulin preparation has been used to determine sites of microtubule elongation in vivo and in vitro. It is difficult to quantitate the stoichiometry of biotin labeling on a routine basis, but early work using radioactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-biotin gave a labeling stochiometry of one to three biotins/tubulin dimer. The final yield of twice cycled biotin-tubulin is about 10{\%} of the starting protein. Tetramethylrhodamine-labeled tubulin has been used to follow microtubules in living cells and it is also used for marking microtubules in real-time in vitro assays.},

Tubulin is routinely obtained from animal brain tissue through repetitive cycles of polymerization–depolymerization, followed by ion-exchange chromatography to remove any contaminating microtubule-associated proteins and motors. Here, we show that only two cycles of polymerization–depolymerization of pig brain tubulin in the presence of a high-molarity PIPES buffer allow the efficient removal of contaminating proteins and production of a high-concentration tubulin solution. The proposed protocol is rapid and yields more active tubulin than the traditional ion-exchange chromatography-based procedures.},

The more dynamic plus ends and the mechanisms that regulate their behavior have been the focus of much recent attention. Here, we concentrate on the dynamics and regulation of minus ends, which play distinct but equally critical roles in microtubule function. In the first part of this review, we compare the in vitro and in vivo behavior of microtubules from a minus end perspective. This comparison suggests that cells possess conserved mechanisms to specifically inhibit minus end polymerization, and perhaps also to actively promote depolymerization. In the second part, we focus on the spatial positioning of minus ends, which is achieved by localized microtubule nucleation, minus end capping and minus end anchoring as well as by motor-dependent sorting. These mechanisms are used in different biological contexts to generate the diversity of organized microtubule arrays in cells.},

  abstract        = {Biological research is in the midst of a revolutionary change due to the inte- gration of powerful technologies along with new concepts and methods derived from inclusion of physical sciences, mathematics, computational sciences, and engineering. As never before, advances in biological sciences hold tremendous promise for surmounting many of the major challenges confronting the United States and the world. Historically, major advances in science have provided solutions to economic and social challenges. At the same time, those challenges have inspired science to focus its attention on critical needs. Scientific efforts based on meeting societal needs have laid the foundation for countless new products, industries, even entire economic sectors that were unimagined when the work began. The lessons of history led the Committee on a New Biology for the 21st Century to recommend that a New Biology Initiative be put in place and charged with finding solutions to major societal needs: sustainable food pro- duction, protection of the environment, renewable energy, and improvement in human health. These challenges represent both the mechanism for accelerating the emergence of a New Biology and its first fruits. Responding to its Statement of Task, the committee found the answer to the question How can a funda- mental understanding of living systems reduce uncertainty about the future of life on earth, improve human health and welfare, and lead to the wise steward- ship of our planet? in calling for a national initiative to apply the potential of the New Biology to addressing these societal challenges. As the report explains, the essence of the New Biology is integration re-integration of the many subdisciplines of biology, and the integration into biology of physicists, chemists, computer scientists, engineers, and mathemati- cians to create a research community with the capacity to tackle a broad range of scientific and societal problems. The committee chose biological approaches to solving problems in the areas of food, environment, energy and health as the most inspiring goals to drive the development of the New Biology. But these are not the only problems that we both hope and expect a thriving New Biology to be able to address; fundamental questions in all areas of biology, from under- standing the brain to carbon cycling in the ocean, will all be more tractable as the New Biology grows into a flourishing reality. Given the fundamental unity of biology, it is our hope and our expectation that the New Biology will contribute to advances across the life sciences. Throughout the report, New Biology is capitalized to emphasize that it is intended to be an additional and complementary effort to traditional life sciences research, not a replacement. Peer-reviewed, independent investigator-initiated research is the foundation on which the New Biology rests and on which it will continue to rely. Many exciting and important areas of biological research are not consid- ered in this report. Americas research capability in life sciences leads the world. This committee strongly endorses current research endeavors, both in the public and private sector. Within biology, the excellent work underway must be continued. But for this study, the intent was not to comprehensively review all life sciences research. Instead the committee focused on those opportunities that cannot be addressed by any one subdiscipline or agencyopportunities that require integration across biology and with other sciences and engineer- ing, and that are difficult to capitalize on within traditional institutional and funding structures. It is not merely the sciences that need to be integrated. The New Biology will draw on the research and development capabilities of universities, govern- ment, and industry. Individual federal agencies will continue to lead important, independent efforts. For the New Biology to flourish, however, interagency co-leadership of projects will be needed to a far greater extent than is the case today. This approach is not simply a matter of funding. The combined capabili- ties and expertise of numerous organizations are required to address societys greatest challenges. This study represents the collective efforts of the committee during meet- ings, workshops, a December 2008 Biology Summit, and many teleconferences. We would like to thank the Summit and workshop participants for their valu- able input. We also thank the committee members who volunteered countless hours and the Board of Life Sciences staff for their efforts and dedication to the study. Americas investment in basic research in the life sciences has paid rich dividends. A commitment to the New Biology will extend this proud record. In the words of President Obama when he addressed the 2009 annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences: As you know, scientific discovery takes far more that the occasional flash of brilliance as important as that can be. Usually, it takes time and hard work and patience; it takes training; it requires the support of a nation. But it holds promise like no other area of human endeavor. The well-being, security, and prosperity of our nation are the prize. We fully endorse the recommendations here presented.},

  abstract = {Summary
              Kinesin motor proteins play a fundamental role for normal neuronal development by controlling intracellular cargo transport and microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton organization. Regulating kinesin activity is important to ensure their proper functioning, and their misregulation often leads to severe human neurological disorders. Homozygous nonsense mutations in kinesin-binding protein (KBP)/KIAA1279 cause the neurological disorder Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS), which is characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, and axonal neuropathy. Here, we show that KBP regulates kinesin activity by interacting with the motor domains of a specific subset of kinesins to prevent their association with the MT cytoskeleton. The KBP-interacting kinesins include cargo-transporting motors such as kinesin-3/KIF1A and MT-depolymerizing motor kinesin-8/KIF18A. We found that KBP blocks KIF1A/UNC-104-mediated synaptic vesicle transport in cultured hippocampal neurons and in C. elegans PVD sensory neurons. In contrast, depletion of KBP results in the accumulation of KIF1A motors and synaptic vesicles in the axonal growth cone. We also show that KBP regulates neuronal MT dynamics by controlling KIF18A activity. Our data suggest that KBP functions as a kinesin inhibitor that modulates MT-based cargo motility and depolymerizing activity of a subset of kinesin motors. We propose that misregulation of KBP-controlled kinesin motors may represent the underlying molecular mechanism that contributes to the neuropathological defects observed in GOSHS patients.},

  abstract  = {Motor proteins in the kinesin-8 family depolymerize microtubules in a length-dependent manner that may be crucial for controlling the length of organelles such as the mitotic spindle. We used single-molecule microscopy to understand the mechanism of length-dependent depolymerization by the budding yeast kinesin-8, Kip3p. We found that after binding at a random position on a microtubule and walking to the plus end, an individual Kip3p molecule pauses there until an incoming Kip3p molecule bumps it off. Kip3p dissociation is accompanied by removal of just one or two tubulin dimers (on average). Such a cooperative mechanism leads to a depolymerization rate that is proportional to the flux of motors to the microtubule end and accounts for the length dependence of depolymerization. This type of feedback between length and disassembly may serve as a model for understanding how an ensemble of molecules can measure and control polymer length. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The microtubule cytoskeleton and the mitotic spindle are highly dynamic structures1, yet their sizes are remarkably constant, thus indicating that the growth and shrinkage of their constituent microtubules are finely balanced2,3. This balance is achieved, in part, through kinesin-8 proteins (such as Kip3p in budding yeast and KLP67A in Drosophila) that destabilize microtubules3,4,5,6,7,8. Here, we directly demonstrate that Kip3p destabilizes microtubules by depolymerizing them — accounting for the effects of kinesin-8 perturbations on microtubule and spindle length observed in fungi and metazoan cells. Furthermore, using single-molecule microscopy assays9, we show that Kip3p has several properties that distinguish it from other depolymerizing kinesins, such as the kinesin-13 MCAK10,11. First, Kip3p disassembles microtubules exclusively at the plus end and second, remarkably, Kip3p depolymerizes longer microtubules faster than shorter ones. These properties are consequences of Kip3p being a highly processive, plus-end-directed motor12, both in vitro and in vivo. Length-dependent depolymerization provides a new mechanism for controlling the lengths of subcellular structures13.},

Here, we show that ASPM forms a complex with another protein linked to microcephaly, the microtubule-severing ATPase katanin. ASPM and katanin localize to spindle poles in a mutually dependent manner and regulate spindle flux. X-ray crystallography revealed that the heterodimer formed by the N- and C-terminal domains of the katanin subunits p60 and p80, respectively, binds conserved motifs in ASPM. Reconstitution experiments demonstrated that ASPM autonomously tracks growing microtubule minus ends and inhibits their growth, while katanin decorates and bends both ends of dynamic microtubules and potentiates the minus-end blocking activity of ASPM. ASPM also binds along microtubules, recruits katanin and promotes katanin-mediated severing of dynamic microtubules. We propose that the ASPM–katanin complex controls microtubule disassembly at spindle poles and that misregulation of this process can lead to microcephaly.},

  abstract = {Inside cells, a multitude of molecular motors and other microtubule-associated proteins are expected to compete for binding to a limited number of binding sites available on microtubules. Little is known about how competition for binding sites affects the processivity of molecular motors and, therefore, cargo transport, organelle positioning, and microtubule organization, processes that all depend on the activity of more or less processive motors. Very few studies have been performed in the past to address this question directly. Most studies reported only minor effects of crowding on the velocity of motors. However, a controversy appears to exist regarding the effect of crowding on motor processivity. Here, we use single-molecule imaging of mGFP-labeled minimal dimeric kinesin-1 constructs in vitro to study the effects of competition on kinesin's processivity. For competitors, we use kinesin rigor mutants as static roadblocks, minimal wild-type kinesins as motile obstacles, and a cell extract as a complex mixture of microtubule-associated proteins. We find that mGFP-labeled kinesin-1 detaches prematurely from microtubules when it encounters obstacles, leading to a strong reduction of its processivity, a behavior that is largely independent of the type of obstacle used here. Kinesin has a low probability to wait briefly when encountering roadblocks. Our data suggest, furthermore, that kinesin can occasionally pass obstacles on the protofilament track.},

Using surface-immobilized microtubules, fluorescently labeled with rhodamine, we demonstrate positional precisions of ∼2 nm when determining the filament centerline and ∼9 nm when localizing the filament tips. Combined with state-of-the-art single particle tracking we apply the algorithm 1), to motor-proteins stepping on immobilized microtubules, 2), to depolymerizing microtubules, and 3), to microtubules gliding over motor-coated surfaces.},

  abstract  = {Recent developments in optical microscopy and nanometer tracking have facilitated our understanding of microtubules and their associated proteins. Using fluorescence microscopy, dynamic interactions are now routinely observed in vitro on the level of single molecules, mainly using a geometry in which labeled motors move on surface-immobilized microtubules. Yet, we think that the historically older gliding geometry, in which motor proteins bound to a substrate surface drive the motion microtubules, offers some unique advantages. (1) Motility can be precisely followed by coupling multiple fluorophores and/or single bright labels to the surface of microtubules without disturbing the activity of the motor proteins. (2) The number of motor proteins involved in active transport can be determined by several strategies. (3) Multimotor studies can be performed over a wide range of motor densities. These advantages allow for studying cooperativity of processive as well as nonprocessive motors. Moreover, the gliding geometry has proven to be most promising for nanotechnological applications of motor proteins operating in synthetic environments. In this chapter we review recent methods related to gliding motility assays in conjunction with 3D-nanometry. In particular, we aim to provide practical advice on how to set up gliding assays, how to acquire high-precision data from microtubules and attached quantum dots, and how to analyze data by 3D-nanometer tracking.},

  abstract = {Microtubules consist of parallel protofilament lanes for motor-based intracellular transport. While most motors translocate along individual protofilaments, members of the kinesin-8 family have been reported to sidestep. However, the mechanism of sidestepping is currently not understood. Here, we track the 3D motion of single kinesin-8 motors on freely suspended microtubules. We find that individual motors sidestep with a bias to the left, the probability of which is increased with the time taken per forward step. We relate this behavior to a bifurcation in the step cycle of kinesin-8. Experiments on a kinesin-1 with an elongated neck linker suggest that sidestepping is intrinsic to all processive kinesins possessing long neck linkers, potentially helping them to circumnavigate obstacles on the microtubule.Kinesin-8 motors, which move in a highly processive manner toward microtubule plus ends where they act as depolymerases, are essential regulators of microtubule dynamics in cells. To understand their navigation strategy on the microtubule lattice, we studied the 3D motion of single yeast kinesin-8 motors, Kip3, on freely suspended microtubules in vitro. We observed short-pitch, left-handed helical trajectories indicating that kinesin-8 motors frequently switch protofilaments in a directionally biased manner. Intriguingly, sidestepping was not directly coupled to forward stepping but rather depended on the average dwell time per forward step under limiting ATP concentrations. Based on our experimental findings and numerical simulations we propose that effective sidestepping toward the left is regulated by a bifurcation in the Kip3 step cycle, involving a transition from a two-head–bound to a one-head–bound conformation in the ATP-waiting state. Results from a kinesin-1 mutant with extended neck linker hint toward a generic sidestepping mechanism for processive kinesins, facilitating the circumvention of intracellular obstacles on the microtubule surface.},

During plant cytokinesis, the kinesin-12 orthologs, PHRAGMOPLAST ORIENTING KINESIN (POK)1 and POK2, are essential for rapid centrifugal expansion of the cytokinetic apparatus, the phragmoplast, toward a pre-selected cell plate fusion site at the cell cortex. Here, we report on the spatio-temporal localization pattern of POK2, mediated by distinct protein domains. Functional dissection of POK2 domains revealed the association of POK2 with the site of the future cell division plane and with the phragmoplast during cytokinesis. Accumulation of POK2 at the phragmoplast midzone depends on its functional POK2 motor domain and is fine-tuned by its carboxy-terminal region that also directs POK2 to the division site. Furthermore, POK2 likely stabilizes the phragmoplast midzone via interaction with the conserved microtubule-associated protein MAP65-3/PLEIADE, a well-established microtubule cross-linker. Collectively, our results suggest that dual localized POK2 plays multiple roles during plant cell division.},

                     Non-centrosomal microtubule bundles play important roles in cellular organization and function. Although many diverse proteins are known that can bundle microtubules, biochemical mechanisms by which cells could locally control the nucleation and formation of microtubule bundles are understudied. Here, we demonstrate that the concentration of tubulin into a condensed, liquid-like compartment composed of the unstructured neuronal protein tau is sufficient to nucleate microtubule bundles. We show that, under conditions of macro-molecular crowding, tau forms liquid-like drops. Tubulin partitions into these drops, efficiently increasing tubulin concentration and driving the nucleation of microtubules. These growing microtubules form bundles, which deform the drops while remaining enclosed by diffusible tau molecules exhibiting a liquid-like behavior. Our data suggest that condensed compartments of microtubule bundling proteins could promote the local formation of microtubule bundles in neurons by acting as non-centrosomal microtubule nucleation centers and that liquid-like tau encapsulation could provide both stability and plasticity to long axonal microtubule bundles.},

Antiparallel microtubule overlaps in the spindle center are essential for establishing bipolarity and maintaining spindle stability throughout mitosis. In anaphase, this antiparallel microtubule array is tightly bundled forming the midzone, which serves as a hub for the recruitment of proteins essential for late mitotic events. The molecular mechanism of midzone formation and the control of its size are not understood. Using an in vitro reconstitution approach, we show here that PRC1 autonomously bundles antiparallel microtubules and recruits Xklp1, a kinesin-4, selectively to overlapping antiparallel microtubules. The processive motor Xklp1 controls overlap size by overlap length-dependent microtubule growth inhibition. Our results mechanistically explain how the two conserved, essential midzone proteins PRC1 and Xklp1 cooperate to constitute a minimal protein module capable of dynamically organizing the core structure of the central anaphase spindle. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Here, we combine structural and single molecule fluorescence methods to examine how PRC1, the human MAP65, crosslinks antiparallel microtubules. We find that PRC1's microtubule binding is mediated by a structured domain with a spectrin-fold and an unstructured Lys/Arg-rich domain. These two domains, at each end of a homodimer, are connected by a linkage that is flexible on single microtubules, but forms well-defined crossbridges between antiparallel filaments. Further, we show that PRC1 crosslinks are compliant and do not substantially resist filament sliding by motor proteins in vitro. Together, our data show how MAP65s, by combining structural flexibility and rigidity, tune microtubule associations to establish crosslinks that selectively " mark" antiparallel overlap in dynamic cytoskeletal networks. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Several proteins selectively bind to these overlaps to control cytokinesis. How midzone bundles assemble is poorly understood. Here, using an in vitro reconstitution approach, we demonstrate that minimal midzone bundles can reliably self-organize in solution from dynamic microtubules, the microtubule crosslinker PRC1, and the motor protein KIF4A. The length of the central antiparallel overlaps in these microtubule bundles is similar to that observed in cells and is controlled by the PRC1/KIF4A ratio. Experiments and computer simulations demonstrate that minimal midzone bundle formation results from promoting antiparallel microtubule crosslinking, stopping microtubule plus-end dynamicity, and motor-driven midzone compaction and alignment. The robustness of this process suggests that a similar self-organization mechanism may contribute to the reorganization of the spindle architecture during the metaphase to anaphase transition in cells. Hannabuss et al. identify a minimal set of proteins that can arrange microtubules in vitro into ordered antiparallel bundles, similar to the ones found in anaphase spindles. Using quantitative imaging and computer simulations, they outline a simple molecular mechanism that explains the self-organization phenomena and its robustness.},

Using optical tweezers, we applied tension to a model of the kinetochore-microtubule interface composed of the yeast Dam1 complex bound to individual dynamic microtubule tips. Higher tension decreased the likelihood that growing tips would begin to shorten, slowed shortening, and increased the likelihood that shortening tips would resume growth.

We show that two major cross-linkers of the conserved MAP65/PRC1/Ase1 family drastically decrease MT rigidity. Their MT-binding domain mediates this effect. Remarkably, the softening effect of MAP65 observed on single MTs is maintained when MTs are cross-linked. By reconstituting physical collisions between growing MTs/MT bundles, we further show that the decrease in MT stiffness induced by MAP65 proteins is responsible for the sharp bending deformations observed in cells when they coalign at a steep angle to create bundles.

  abstract        = {Background: Microtubules in interphase Schizosaccharomyces pombe are essential for maintaining the linear growth habit of these cells. The dynamics of assembly and disassembly of these microtubules are so far uncharacterised. Results: Live cell confocal imaging of $\alpha$1 tubulin tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein revealed longitudinally oriented, dynamically unstable interphase microtubule assemblies (IMAs). The IMAs were uniformly bright along their length apart from a zone of approximately doubly intense fluorescence commonly present close to their centres. The ends of each IMA switched from growth ({\~{}}3.0 $\mu$m/min) to shrinkage ({\~{}}4.5 $\mu$m/min) at 1.0 events per minute and from shrinkage to growth at 1.9 events per minute, and the two ends were equivalently dynamic, suggesting equivalent structure. We accordingly propose a symmetrical model for microtubule packing within the IMAs, in which microtubules are plus ends out and overlap close to the equator of the cell. IMAs may contain multiple copies of this motif; if so, then within each IMA end, the microtubule ends must synchronise catastrophe and rescue. When both ends of an IMA lodge in the hemispherical cell ends, the IMAs start to bend under compression and their overall growth rate is inhibited about twofold. Similar microtubule dynamics were observed in cells ranging in size from half to twice normal length. Patterned photobleaching indicated no detectable treadmilling or microtubule sliding during interphase. Conclusions: The consequence of the mechanisms described is continuous recruitment of microtubule ends to the ends of growing cells, supporting microtubule-based transport into the cell ends and qualitatively accounting for the essential role for microtubules in directing linear cell growth in S. pombe.},

Using fluorescence live cell imaging, we show that ase1p localizes to sites of microtubule overlaps associated with microtubule organizing centers at both interphase and mitosis. ase1? mutants fail to form overlapping antiparallel microtubule bundles, leading to interphase nuclear positioning defects, and premature mitotic spindle collapse. FRAP analysis revealed that interphase ase1p at overlapping microtubule minus ends is highly dynamic. In contrast, mitotic ase1p at microtubule plus ends at the spindle midzone is more stable. We propose that ase1p functions to organize microtubules into overlapping antiparallel bundles both in interphase and mitosis and that ase1p may be differentially regulated through the cell cycle.},

  abstract        = {Microtubules (MTs) are highly dynamical structures that play a crucial role in cell physiology. In cooperation with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), MTs form bundles endowing cells with specific mechanisms to control their shape or generate forces. Whether the dynamics of MTs is affected by the lateral connections that MAPs make between MTs during bundle formation is still under debate. Using in vitro reconstitution of MT bundling, we analyzed the dynamics of MT bundles generated by two plant MAP65 (MAP65-1/4), MAP65-1 being the plant ortholog of vertebrate PRC1 and yeast Ase1. MAP65-1/4 limit the amplitude of MT bundle depolymerization and increase the elongation phases. The subsequent sustained elongation of bundles is governed by the coordination of MT growth, so that MT ends come in close vicinity. We develop a model based on the assumption that both MAP65-1/4 block MT depolymerization. Model simulations reveal that rescue frequencies are higher between parallel than between anti-parallel MTs. In consequence the polarity of bundled MTs by MAP65 controls the amplitude of bundle's growth. Our results illustrate how MAP-induced MT-bundling, which is finely tuned by MT polarity, robustly coordinates MT elongation within bundles.},

  abstract        = {How cells regulate microtubule crosslinking activity to control the rate and duration of spindle elongation during anaphase is poorly understood. In this study, we test the hypothesis that PRC1/Ase1 proteins use distinct microtubule-binding domains to control spindle elongation rate. Using budding-yeast Ase1, we identify unique contributions for the spectrin and carboxy-terminal domains during different phases of spindle elongation. We show that the spectrin domain uses conserved, basic residues to promote the recruitment of Ase1 to the midzone before anaphase onset and slow spindle elongation during early anaphase. In contrast, a partial Ase1 carboxy-terminal truncation fails to form a stable midzone in late anaphase, produces faster elongation rates after early anaphase, and exhibits frequent spindle collapses. We find that the carboxy-terminal domain interacts with the plus-end tracking protein EB1/Bim1 and recruits Bim1 to the midzone to maintain midzone length. Overall, our results suggest that the Ase1 domains provide cells with a modular system to tune midzone activity and control elongation rates.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.SPBSpindle Pole BodyGFPGreen Fluorescent ProteinFWHMFull-Width Half-MaxCIConfidence Interval},

  abstract        = {Short regions of overlap between ends of antiparallel microtubules are central elements within bipolar microtubule arrays. Although their formation requires motors, recent in vitro studies demonstrated that stable overlaps cannot be generated by molecular motors alone. Motors either slide microtubules along each other until complete separation or, in the presence of opposing motors, generate oscillatory movements. Here, we show that Ase1, a member of the conserved MAP65/PRC1 family of microtubule-bundling proteins, enables the formation of stable antiparallel overlaps through adaptive braking of Kinesin-14-driven microtubule-microtubule sliding. As overlapping microtubules start to slide apart, Ase1 molecules become compacted in the shrinking overlap and the sliding velocity gradually decreases in a dose-dependent manner. Compaction is driven by moving microtubule ends that act as barriers to Ase1 diffusion. Quantitative modelling showed that the molecular off-rate of Ase1 is sufficiently low to enable persistent overlap stabilization over tens of minutes. The finding of adaptive braking demonstrates that sliding can be slowed down locally to stabilize overlaps at the centre of bipolar arrays, whereas sliding proceeds elsewhere to enable network self-organization.},

The subsequent sorting of short MTs into networks like the mitotic spindle requires molecular motors that laterally slide overlapping MTs and bundling proteins that statically connect MTs. How bundling proteins interfere with MT sliding is unclear. In bipolar MT bundles in fission yeast, we found that the bundler ase1p localized all along the length of antiparallel MTs, whereas the motor klp2p (kinesin-14) accumulated only at MT plus ends. Consequently, sliding forces could only overcome resistant bundling forces for short, newly nucleated MTs, which were transported to their correct position within bundles. Ase1p thus regulated sliding forces based on polarity and overlap length, and computer simulations showed these mechanisms to be sufficient to generate stable bipolar bundles. By combining motor and bundling proteins, cells can thus dynamically organize stable regions of overlap between cytoskeletal filaments. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Remodeling of the cytoskeleton is important for key cellular processes, such as cell motility, division, or morphogenesis. This remodeling is traditionally considered to be driven exclusively by processes consuming chemical energy, such as the dynamics of the filaments or the action of molecular motors. Here, we review two mechanisms of cytoskeletal network remodeling that are independent of the consumption of chemical energy. In both cases directed motion of overlapping filaments is driven by entropic forces, which arise from harnessing thermal energy present in solution. Entropic forces are induced either by macromolecular crowding agents or by diffusible crosslinkers confined to the regions where filaments overlap. Both mechanisms increase filament overlap length and lead to the contraction of filament networks. These force-generating mechanisms, together with the chemical energy-dependent mechanisms, need to be considered for the comprehensive quantitative picture of the remodeling of cytoskeletal networks in cells.},

Here, we show that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe CLASP, cls1p/peg1p, mediates the stabilization of overlapping MTs within the mitotic spindle and interphase bundles. cls1p localizes to these regions but not to interphase MT plus ends. Inactivation of cls1p leads to the rapid depolymerization of spindle midzone MTs. cls1p also stabilizes a subset of MTs within interphase bundles. cls1p prevents disassembly of the entire microtubule, while still allowing for plus-end growth. It has no measurable effects on MT nucleation, polymerization, catastrophe, or bundling. A direct interaction with ase1p (PRC1/MAP65) targets cls1p to regions of antiparallel MT overlap. These findings show how a MT-stabilizing factor attached to specific sites on MTs can help to generate MT structures that have both dynamic and stable components. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract        = {Cysteine residues in tubulin are actively involved in regulating ligand interactions and microtubule formation both in vivo and in vitro. These cysteine residues are sensitive reporters in determining the conformation of tubulin. Although some of the cysteines are critical in modulating drug binding and microtubule assembly, it is not clear how many of these normally exist as disulfides. The controversy regarding the disulfide bonds led us to develop a disulfide detection assay to reexamine the presence of the disulfide linkages in purified alphabeta tubulin and explore their possible biological functions in vitro. The accessible cysteine residues in alphabeta tubulin were alkylated with an excess of iodoacetamide to prevent artifactual generation of disulfide linkages in tubulin. After removal of excess iodoacetamide, tubulin was unfolded in 8 M urea. Half of the unfolded tubulin was treated with dithiothreitol to reduce any disulfide bonds present. The aliquots were then treated with iodo[(14)C]acetamide and the incorporation of radioactivity was measured. We also used the same approach to detect the disulfide linkages in the tubulin in a whole-cell extract. We found in both cases that the samples which were not treated with dithiothreitol had little or no incorporation of iodo[(14)C]acetamide, while the others that were treated with dithiothreitol had significant amounts of (14)C incorporation into tubulin. Moreover, the reduction of the disulfide linkages in tubulin resulted in inhibition of microtubule assembly (29-54{\%}) and markedly affected refolding of the tubulin from both an intermediate and a completely unfolded state. All these data therefore suggest that tubulin has intrachain disulfide bonds in the alpha- and beta-subunits and that these disulfides assist in correct refolding of tubulin from the intermediate unfolded state or help to recover the hydrophobic domains from the completely unfolded state. These disulfides also regulate microtubule assembly and the stability of tubulin in vitro. Our results suggest that tubulin disulfides may play a role in tubulin folding and that thiol-disulfide exchange in tubulin could be a key regulator in microtubule assembly and dynamics of tubulin in vivo.},

Although they are highly rigid polymers with a persistence length of 1-8 mm, they may exhibit a curved shape at a scale of few micrometers within cells, depending on their biological functions. However, how MT flexural rigidity in cells is regulated remains poorly understood. Here we ask whether MT-associated proteins (MAPs) could locally control the mechanical properties of MTs. We show that two major cross-linkers of the conserved MAP65/PRC1/Ase1 family drastically decrease MT rigidity. Their MT-binding domain mediates this effect. Remarkably, the softening effect of MAP65 observed on single MTs is maintained when MTs are cross-linked. By reconstituting physical collisions between growing MTs/MT bundles, we further show that the decrease in MT stiffness induced by MAP65 proteins is responsible for the sharp bending deformations observed in cells when they coalign at a steep angle to create bundles. Taken together, these data provide new insights into how MAP65, by modifying MT mechanical properties, may regulate the formation of complex MT arrays.},

MT rescue, in which a MT stops shrinking and reinitiates growth, is the least understood aspect of MT dynamics. Cytoplasmic Linker Associated Proteins (CLASPs) are a conserved class of MT-associated proteins that contribute to MT stabilization and rescue in vivo. We show here that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe CLASP, Cls1p, is a homodimer that binds an ????-tubulin heterodimer through conserved TOG-like domains. In vitro, CLASP increases MT rescue frequency, decreases MT catastrophe frequency, and moderately decreases MT disassembly rate. CLASP binds stably to the MT lattice, recruits tubulin, and locally promotes rescues. Mutations in the CLASP TOG domains demonstrate that tubulin binding is critical for its rescue activity. We propose a mechanism for rescue in which CLASP-tubulin dimer complexes bind along the MT lattice and reverse MT depolymerization with their bound tubulin dimer. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Its hyperphosphorylation is thought to cause detachment from MTs and subsequent aggregation into fibrils implicated in Alzheimer's disease. It is unclear which tau residues are crucial for tau-MT interactions, where tau binds on MTs, and how it stabilizes them. We used cryo–electron microscopy to visualize different tau constructs on MTs, and computational approaches to generate atomic models of tau-tubulin interactions. The conserved tubulin-binding repeats within tau adopt similar extended structures along the crest of the protofilament, stabilizing the interface between tubulin dimers. Our structures explain the effect of phosphorylation on MT affinity and lead to a model of tau repeats binding in tandem along protofilaments, tethering together tubulin dimers and stabilizing polymerization interfaces.},

CLASPs are conserved MT-binding proteins implicated in the regulation of MT plus ends. Here, we show that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe CLASP, cls1p/peg1p, mediates the stabilization of overlapping MTs within the mitotic spindle and interphase bundles. cls1p localizes to these regions but not to interphase MT plus ends. Inactivation of cls1p leads to the rapid depolymerization of spindle midzone MTs. cls1p also stabilizes a subset of MTs within interphase bundles. cls1p prevents disassembly of the entire microtubule, while still allowing for plus-end growth. It has no measurable effects on MT nucleation, polymerization, catastrophe, or bundling. A direct interaction with ase1p (PRC1/MAP65) targets cls1p to regions of antiparallel MT overlap. These findings show how a MT-stabilizing factor attached to specific sites on MTs can help to generate MT structures that have both dynamic and stable components. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract        = {Background The dynamic properties of microtubules depend on complex nanoscale structural rearrangements in their end regions. Members of the EB1 and XMAP215 protein families interact autonomously with microtubule ends. EB1 recruits several other proteins to growing microtubule ends and has seemingly antagonistic effects on microtubule dynamics: it induces catastrophes, and it increases growth velocity, as does the polymerase XMAP215. Results Using a combination of in vitro reconstitution, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, and subpixel-precision image analysis and convolved model fitting, we have studied the effects of EB1 on conformational transitions in growing microtubule ends and on the time course of catastrophes. EB1 density distributions at growing microtubule ends reveal two consecutive conformational transitions in the microtubule end region, which have growth-velocity-independent kinetics. EB1 binds to the microtubule after the first and before the second conformational transition has occurred, positioning it several tens of nanometers behind XMAP215, which binds to the extreme microtubule end. EB1 binding accelerates conformational maturation in the microtubule, most likely by promoting lateral protofilament interactions and by accelerating reactions of the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis cycle. The microtubule maturation time is directly linked to the duration of a growth pause just before microtubule depolymerization, indicating an important role of the maturation time for the control of dynamic instability. Conclusions These activities establish EB1 as a microtubule maturation factor and provide a mechanistic explanation for its effects on microtubule growth and catastrophe frequency, which cause microtubules to be more dynamic. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract        = {Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mal3 is a member of the EB family of proteins, which are proposed to be core elements in a tip-tracking network that regulates microtubule dynamics in cells. How Mal3 itself influences microtubule dynamics is unclear. We tested the effects of full-length recombinant Mal3 on dynamic microtubules assembled in vitro from purified S. pombe tubulin, using dark field video microscopy to avoid fluorescent tagging and data-averaging techniques to improve spatiotemporal resolution. We find that catastrophe occurs stochastically as a fast ({\textless}2.2 s) transition from constant speed growth to constant speed shrinkage with a constant probability that is independent of the Mal3 concentration. This implies that Mal3 neither stabilizes nor destabilizes microtubule tips. Mal3 does, however, stabilize the main part of the microtubule lattice, inhibiting shrinkage and increasing the frequency of rescues, consistent with recent models in which Mal3 on the lattice forms stabilizing lateral links between neighboring protofilaments. At high concentrations, Mal3 can entirely block shrinkage and induce very rapid rescue, making catastrophes impossible to detect, which may account for the apparent suppression of catastrophe by Mal3 and other EBs in vivo. Overall, we find that Mal3 stabilizes microtubules not by preventing catastrophe at the microtubule tip but by inhibiting lattice depolymerization and enhancing rescue. We argue that this implies that Mal3 binds microtubules in different modes at the tip and on the lattice.},

A plethora of computer algorithms have been developed to monitor the sub-pixel displacement of fluorescent objects between successive video frames, and some have been claimed to have "nanometer" resolution. To date, there has been no rigorous comparison of these algorithms under realistic conditions. In this paper, we quantitatively compare specific implementations of four commonly used tracking algorithms: cross-correlation, sum-absolute difference, centroid, and direct Gaussian fit. Images of fluorescent objects ranging in size from point sources to 5 microm were computer generated with known sub-pixel displacements. Realistic noise was added and the above four algorithms were compared for accuracy and precision. We found that cross-correlation is the most accurate algorithm for large particles. However, for point sources, direct Gaussian fit to the intensity distribution is the superior algorithm in terms of both accuracy and precision, and is the most robust at low signal-to-noise. Most significantly, all four algorithms fail as the signal-to-noise ratio approaches 4. We judge direct Gaussian fit to be the best algorithm when tracking single fluorophores, where the signal-to-noise is frequently near 4.},

  abstract        = {The microtubule cytoskeleton is essential to cell morphogenesis. Growing microtubule plus ends have emerged as dynamic regulatory sites in which specialized proteins, called plus-end-binding proteins (+TIPs), bind and regulate the proper functioning of microtubules. However, the molecular mechanism of plus-end association by +TIPs and their ability to track the growing end are not well understood. Here we report the in vitro reconstitution of a minimal plus-end tracking system consisting of the three fission yeast proteins Mal3, Tip1 and the kinesin Tea2. Using time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that the EB1 homologue Mal3 has an enhanced affinity for growing microtubule end structures as opposed to the microtubule lattice. This allows it to track growing microtubule ends autonomously by an end recognition mechanism. In addition, Mal3 acts as a factor that mediates loading of the processive motor Tea2 and its cargo, the Clip170 homologue Tip1, onto the microtubule lattice. The interaction of all three proteins is required for the selective tracking of growing microtubule plus ends by both Tea2 and Tip1. Our results dissect the collective interactions of the constituents of this plus-end tracking system and show how these interactions lead to the emergence of its dynamic behaviour. We expect that such in vitro reconstitutions will also be essential for the mechanistic dissection of other plus-end tracking systems.},

Using electron microscopy (EM) and high-resolution surface shadowing we have studied the microtubule-binding properties of the fission yeast EB1 homolog Mal3p. This allowed for a direct visualization of Mal3p bound on the surface of microtubules. Mal3p particles usually formed a single line on each microtubule along just one of the multiple grooves that are formed by adjacent protofilaments. We provide structural data showing that the alignment of Mal3p molecules coincides with the microtubule lattice seam as well as data suggesting that Mal3p not only binds but also stabilizes this seam. Accordingly, Mal3p stabilizes microtubules through a specific interaction with what is potentially the weakest part of the microtubule in a way not previously demonstrated. Our findings further suggest that microtubules exhibit two distinct reaction platforms on their surface that can independently interact with target structures such as microtubule-associated proteins, motors, kinetochores, or membranes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

High ionic strength (I0.2), low temperature (T less than 30 degrees C) and elevated Mg2+ (greater than or equal to 1.2 mM) induce a transition from biphasic to monophasic kinetics. Comparison of the activation energy obtained for the fast biphasic step at low ionic strength (I0.069) shows excellent agreement with the values obtained at high ionic strength, low temperature and elevated Mg2+. From this observation it can be implied that the tubulin-containing reactant of the fast biphasic event is also the species that elongates microtubules during monophasic assembly. Second-order rate constants for biphasic assembly are 3.82(+/- 0.72) x 10(7) M-1.s-1 and 5.19(+/- 1.25) x 10(6) M-1.s-1, and for monophasic assembly the rate constant is 2.12(+/- 0.56) x 10(7) M-1.s-1.

Although there is a clear role for microtubule (MT) motor proteins at the spindle midzone, less is known about how microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) contribute to midzone organization and function. Here, we report that budding yeast Ase1p is a member of a conserved family of midzone-specific MAPs. By size exclusion chromatography and velocity sedimentation, both Ase1p in extracts and purified Ase1p behaved as a homodimer. Ase1p bound and bundled MTs in vitro. By live cell microscopy, loss of Ase1p resulted in a specific defect: premature spindle disassembly in mid-anaphase. Furthermore, when overexpressed, Ase1p was sufficient to trigger spindle elongation in S phase-arrested cells. FRAP revealed that Ase1p has both a very slow rate of turnover within the midzone and limited lateral diffusion along spindle MTs. We propose that Ase1p functions as an MT cross-bridge that imparts matrix-like characteristics to the midzone. MT-dependent networks of spindle midzone MAPs may be one molecular basis for the postulated spindle matrix.},

We first provide a review of the experimental and modeling literature, and then present a new model of microtubule dynamics. We demonstrate that vectorial, random, and coupled hydrolysis mechanisms are not consistent with the dependence of catastrophe on tubulin concentration and show that, although single-protofilament models can explain many features of dynamics, they do not describe catastrophe as a multistep process. Finally, we present a new combined (coupled plus random hydrolysis) multiple-protofilament model that is a simple, analytically solvable generalization of a single-protofilament model. This model accounts for the observed lifetimes of growing microtubules, the delay to catastrophe following dilution and describes catastrophe as a multistep process.},

  abstract        = {The exchange of tubulin dimer into steady-state microtubules was studied over a range of solution conditions, in order to assess the effects of various common buffer components on the dynamic instability of microtubules. In comparison with standard buffer conditions (100 mM-Pipes buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.1 mM-EGTA, 1.8 mM-MgC12 and 1 M-glycerol), the rate and extent of exchange, and thus of dynamic instability, are suppressed by increasing the concentration of glycerol above 2 M. Exchange is enhanced by the addition of further Mg2+ (up to 17 mM) or by the addition of Ca2+ (up to 0.4 mM). Phosphate ion (150 mM) has relatively little effect on the dynamic behaviour of microtubules, as judged by the exchange method. The findings are interpreted within the framework of the Lateral Cap model for microtubule dynamic instability, in terms of the effects of these changes on the intrinsic rate constants of the system. By contrast, the extent of tubulin exchange depends selectively on the value of the dissociation rate constant for tubulin-GDP. A decrease in the extent of exchange, and hence in dynamic activity, is associated with a decreased value for this rate constant, and vice versa. The results also show good agreement of predictions of the model in treating the observed variations in the dynamic properties of individual microtubules, induced by different solution conditions.},

  abstract        = {In the presence of GTP, purified dimers of alpha- and beta-tubulin will interact longitudinally and laterally to self-assemble into microtubules (MTs). This property provides a powerful in vitro experimental system to describe MT dynamic behavior at the micrometer scale and to study effects and functioning of a large variety of microtubule associated proteins (MAPs). Despite the plethora of such data produced, the molecular mechanisms of MT assembly remain disputed. Electron microscopy (EM) studies suggested that tubulin dimers interact longitudinally to form short oligomers which form a tube by lateral interaction and which contribute to MT elongation. This idea is however challenged: Based on estimated association constants it was proposed that single dimers represent the major fraction of free tubulin. This view was recently supported by measurements suggesting that MTs elongate by addition of single tubulin dimers. To solve this discrepancy, we performed a direct measurement of the longitudinal interaction energy for tubulin dimers. We quantified the size distribution of tubulin oligomers using EM and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). From the distribution we derived the longitudinal interaction energy in the presence of GDP and the non-hydrolysable GTP analog GMPCPP. Our data suggest that MT elongation and nucleation involves interactions of short tubulin oligomers rather than dimers. Our approach provides a solid experimental framework to better understand the role of MAPs in MT nucleation and growth.},

Here, we found that microtubules can be directly remodelled into branched structures by the microtubule-remodelling factor SSNA1 (also known as NA14 or DIP13). The branching activity of SSNA1 relies on its ability to self-assemble into fibrils in a head-to-tail fashion. SSNA1 fibrils guide protofilaments of a microtubule to split apart to form daughter microtubules. We further found that SSNA1 localizes at axon branching sites and has a key role in neuronal development. SSNA1 mutants that abolish microtubule branching in vitro also fail to promote axon development and branching when overexpressed in neurons. We have, therefore, discovered a mechanism for microtubule branching and implicated its role in neuronal development.},

However, microtubule lattice diffusion (also known as diffusional motility) provides a second mode of transport that is shared by a much broader class of microtubule binding proteins. Microtubule lattice diffusion offers distinct advantages as a transport mechanism including speed, bidirectional microtubule end targeting, and no requirement for direct chemical energy (i.e. ATP). It remains to be seen whether a universal binding mechanism for this interaction will be identified but electrostatic interactions appear to play a significant role. In the meantime, the well-studied subject of DNA binding proteins that diffuse along the DNA backbone provides an insightful analog for understanding the nature of microtubule-based diffusional motility. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The rules that determine which of the various +TIPs are recruited to the limited number of available binding sites at microtubule ends remain poorly understood. Here we examined how the human dynein complex, the main minus-end-directed motor and an important +TIP (refs , , ), is targeted to growing microtubule ends in the presence of different +TIP competitors. Using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy-based reconstitution assay, we found that a hierarchical recruitment mode targets the large dynactin subunit p150Glued to growing microtubule ends via EB1 and CLIP-170 in the presence of competing SxIP-motif-containing peptides. We further show that the human dynein complex is targeted to growing microtubule ends through an interaction of the tail domain of dynein with p150Glued. Our results highlight how the connectivity and hierarchy within dynamic +TIP networks are orchestrated.},

The mechanical forces driving the restructuring are attributed to the action of molecular motors and the dynamics of cytoskeletal filaments, which both consume chemical energy. By contrast, non-enzymatic filament crosslinkers are regarded as mere friction-generating entities. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that diffusible microtubule crosslinkers of the {\{}Ase1/PRC1/Map65{\}} family generate directed microtubule sliding when confined between partially overlapping microtubules. The Ase1-generated forces, directly measured by optical tweezers to be in the piconewton-range, were sufficient to antagonize motor-protein driven microtubule sliding. Force generation is quantitatively explained by the entropic expansion of confined Ase1 molecules diffusing within the microtubule overlaps. The{\~{}}thermal motion of crosslinkers is thus harnessed to generate mechanical work analogous to compressed gas propelling a piston in a cylinder. As confinement of diffusible proteins is ubiquitous in cells, the associated entropic forces are likely of importance for cellular mechanics beyond cytoskeletal networks.},

The identification of tubulin isotypes and of regions of the microtubule involved in drug interactions has been advanced by proteomic methodologies. The diversity of tubulin sequences and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) can generate a complex mixture of heterodimers with unique molecular dynamics driving specific functions. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches have been developed, and in combination with chromatographic and/or electrophoretic separation of tubulin polypeptides or peptides, they have contributed to our understanding of tubulin proteomics. We present protocols that we have used for the analysis of tubulin isotypes and PTMs present in tubulin isolated from cells in culture or tissues and for the identification of tubulin regions altered by microtubule-stabilizing agents. Tubulin proteomics complements structural and computer modeling information for a high-resolution view of microtubule dynamics and its alteration by drugs. These methodologies will help in providing insights into tubulin isotype-specific functions and in the design of drugs targeting either all tubulin heterodimers indiscriminately or only those containing specific isotypes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract        = {Microtubules undergo alternating periods of growth and shortening, known as dynamic instability. These dynamics allow microtubule plus ends to explore cellular space. The "search and capture" model posits that selective anchoring of microtubule plus ends at the cell cortex may contribute to cell polarization, spindle orientation, or targeted trafficking to specific cellular domains [1-3]. Whereas cytoplasmic dynein is primarily known as a minus-end-directed microtubule motor for organelle transport, cortically localized dynein has been shown to capture and tether microtubules at the cell periphery in both dividing and interphase cells [3-7]. To explore the mechanism involved, we developed a minimal in vitro system, with dynein-bound beads positioned near microtubule plus ends using an optical trap. Dynein induced a significant reduction in the lateral diffusion of microtubule ends, distinct from the effects of other microtubule-associated proteins such as kinesin-1 and EB1. In assays with dynamic microtubules, dynein delayed barrier-induced catastrophe of microtubules. This effect was ATP dependent, indicating that dynein motor activity was required. Computational modeling suggests that dynein delays catastrophe by exerting tension on individual protofilaments, leading to microtubule stabilization. Thus, dynein-mediated capture and tethering of microtubules at the cortex can lead to enhanced stability of dynamic plus ends. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Current models for the intracellular transport of Tau protein suggest motor protein-dependent co-transport with microtubule fragments and diffusion of Tau in the cytoplasm, whereas Tau is believed to be stationary while bound to microtubules and in equilibrium with free diffusion in the cytosol. Observations that members of the microtubule-dependent kinesin family show Brownian motion along microtubules led us to hypothesize that diffusion along microtubules could also be relevant in the case of Tau. We used single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to probe for diffusion of individual fluorescently labeled Tau molecules along microtubules. This allowed us to avoid the problem that microtubule-dependent diffusion could be masked by excess of labeled Tau in solution that might occur in in vivo overexpression experiments. We found that approximately half of the individually detected Tau molecules moved bidirectionally along microtubules over distances up to several micrometers. Diffusion parameters such as diffusion coefficient, interaction time, and scanned microtubule length did not change with Tau concentration. Tau binding and diffusion along the microtubule lattice, however, were sensitive to ionic strength and pH and drastically reduced upon enzymatic removal of the negatively charged C termini of tubulin. We propose one-dimensional Tau diffusion guided by the microtubule lattice as one possible additional mechanism for Tau distribution. By such one-dimensional microtubule lattice diffusion, Tau could be guided to both microtubule ends, i.e. the sites where Tau is needed during microtubule polymerization, independently of directed motor-dependent transport. This could be important in conditions where active transport along microtubules might be compromised.},

  abstract        = {Microtubules are long cylindrical polymers composed of tubulin subunits. In cells, microtubules play an essential role in architecture and motility. For example, microtubules give shape to cells, serve as intracellular transport tracks, and act as key elements in important cellular structures such as axonemes and mitotic spindles. To accomplish these varied functions, networks of microtubules in cells are very dynamic, continuously remodeling through stochastic length fluctuations at the ends of individual microtubules. The dynamic behavior at the end of an individual microtubule is termed 'dynamic instability'. This behavior manifests itself by periods of persistent microtubule growth interrupted by occasional switching to rapid shrinkage (called microtubule 'catastrophe'), and then by switching back from shrinkage to growth (called microtubule 'rescue'). In this review, we summarize recent findings which provide new insights into the mechanisms of microtubule catastrophe and rescue, and discuss the impact of these findings in regards to the role of microtubule dynamics inside of cells. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {An important function of microtubules is to move cellular structures such as chromosomes, mitotic spindles and other organelles around inside cells. This is achieved by attaching the ends of microtubules to cellular structures; as the microtubules grow and shrink, the structures are pushed or pulled around the cell. How do the ends of microtubules couple to cellular structures, and how does this coupling regulate the stability and distribution of the microtubules? It is now clear that there are at least three properties of a microtubule end: it has alternate structures; it has a biochemical transition defined by GTP hydrolysis; and it forms a distinct target for the binding of specific proteins. These different properties can be unified by thinking of the microtubule as a molecular machine, which switches between growing and shrinking modes. Each mode is associated with a specific end structure on which end-binding proteins can assemble to modulate dynamics and couple the dynamic properties of microtubules to the movement of cellular structures.},

However, extracting molecule-specific information from fluorescence images is often limited by the noise and blur intrinsic to the cell and the imaging system. Here we discuss a method called "model-convolution," which uses experimentally measured noise and blur to simulate the process of imaging fluorescent proteins whose spatial distribution cannot be resolved. We then compare model-convolution to the more standard approach of experimental deconvolution. In some circumstances, standard experimental deconvolution approaches fail to yield the correct underlying fluorophore distribution. In these situations, model-convolution removes the uncertainty associated with deconvolution and therefore allows direct statistical comparison of experimental and theoretical data. Thus, if there are structural constraints on molecular organization, the model-convolution method better utilizes information gathered via fluorescence microscopy, and naturally integrates experiment and theory.},

  abstract        = {Short regions of overlap between ends of antiparallel microtubules are central elements within bipolar microtubule arrays. Although their formation requires motors, recent in vitro studies demonstrated that stable overlaps cannot be generated by molecular motors alone. Motors either slide microtubules along each other until complete separation or, in the presence of opposing motors, generate oscillatory movements. Here, we show that Ase1, a member of the conserved MAP65/PRC1 family of microtubule-bundling proteins, enables the formation of stable antiparallel overlaps through adaptive braking of Kinesin-14-driven microtubule-microtubule sliding. As overlapping microtubules start to slide apart, Ase1 molecules become compacted in the shrinking overlap and the sliding velocity gradually decreases in a dose-dependent manner. Compaction is driven by moving microtubule ends that act as barriers to Ase1 diffusion. Quantitative modelling showed that the molecular off-rate of Ase1 is sufficiently low to enable persistent overlap stabilization over tens of minutes. The finding of adaptive braking demonstrates that sliding can be slowed down locally to stabilize overlaps at the centre of bipolar arrays, whereas sliding proceeds elsewhere to enable network self-organization.},

  abstract        = {Microtubule (MT) crosslinking proteins of the ase1p/PRC1/Map65 family play a major role in the construction of MT networks such as the mitotic spindle. Most homologs in this family have been shown to localize with a remarkable specificity to sets of MTs that overlap with an antiparallel relative orientation [1-4]. Regulatory proteins bind to ase1p/PRC1/Map65 and appear to use the localization to set up precise spatial signals [5-10]. Here, we present evidence for a mechanism of localized protein multimerization underlying the specific targeting of ase1p, the fision yeast homolog. In controlled in??vitro experiments, dimers of ase1-GFP diffused along??the surface of single MTs and, at concentrations above a certain threshold, assembled into static multimeric structures. We observed that this threshold was significantly lower on overlapping MTs. We also observed diffusion and multimerization of ase1-GFP on MTs inside living cells, suggesting??that a multimerization-driven localization mechanism is relevant in??vivo. The domains responsible for MT binding and multimerization were identified via a series of ase1p truncations. Our findings show that cells use a finely tuned cooperative localization mechanism that exploits differences in the geometry and concentration of ase1p binding sites along single and overlapping MTs. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract        = {Despite the crowdedness of the interior of cells, microtubule-based motor proteins are able to deliver cargoes rapidly and reliably throughout the cytoplasm. We hypothesize that motor proteins may be adapted to operate in crowded environments by having molecular properties that prevent them from forming traffic jams. To test this hypothesis, we reconstituted high-density traffic of purified kinesin-8 motor protein, a highly processive motor with long end-residency time, along microtubules in a total internal-reflection fluorescence microscopy assay. We found that traffic jams, characterized by an abrupt increase in the density of motors with an associated abrupt decrease in motor speed, form even in the absence of other obstructing proteins. To determine the molecular properties that lead to jamming, we altered the concentration of motors, their processivity, and their rate of dissociation from microtubule ends. Traffic jams occurred when the motor density exceeded a critical value (density-induced jams) or when motor dissociation from the microtubule ends was so slow that it resulted in a pileup (bottleneck-induced jams). Through comparison of our experimental results with theoretical models and stochastic simulations, we characterized in detail under which conditions densityand bottleneck-induced traffic jams form or do not form. Our results indicate that transport kinesins, such as kinesin-1, may be evolutionarily adapted to avoid the formation of traffic jams by moving only with moderate processivity and dissociating rapidly from microtubule ends.},

Here, we combine structural and single molecule fluorescence methods to examine how PRC1, the human MAP65, crosslinks antiparallel microtubules. We find that PRC1's microtubule binding is mediated by a structured domain with a spectrin-fold and an unstructured Lys/Arg-rich domain. These two domains, at each end of a homodimer, are connected by a linkage that is flexible on single microtubules, but forms well-defined crossbridges between antiparallel filaments. Further, we show that PRC1 crosslinks are compliant and do not substantially resist filament sliding by motor proteins in vitro. Together, our data show how MAP65s, by combining structural flexibility and rigidity, tune microtubule associations to establish crosslinks that selectively " mark" antiparallel overlap in dynamic cytoskeletal networks. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract        = {The motor proteins kinesin and dynein transport organelles, mRNA, proteins, and signaling molecules along the microtubule cytoskeleton. In addition to serving as tracks for transport, the microtubule cytoskeleton directs intracellular trafficking by regulating the activity of motor proteins through the organization of the filament network, microtubule-associated proteins, and tubulin posttranslational modifications. However, it is not well understood how these factors influence motor motility, and in vitro assays and live cell observations often produce disparate results. To systematically examine the factors that contribute to cytoskeleton-based regulation of motor protein motility, we extracted intact microtubule networks from cells and tracked the motility of single fluorescently labeled motor proteins on these cytoskeletons. We find that tubulin acetylation alone does not directly affect kinesin-1 motility. However, acetylated microtubules are predominantly bundled, and bundling enhances kinesin run lengths and provides a greater number of available kinesin binding sites. The neuronal MAP tau is also not sensitive to tubulin acetylation, but enriches preferentially on highly curved regions of microtubules where it strongly inhibits kinesin motility. Taken together, these results suggest that the organization of the microtubule network is a key contributor to the regulation of motor-based transport.},

Current models for microtubule assembly kinetics assume that the subunit dissociation rate from a microtubule tip is independent of free subunit concentration. Total-Internal-Reflection-Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy experiments and data from a laser tweezers assay that measures in vitro microtubule assembly with nanometer resolution, provides evidence that the subunit dissociation rate from a microtubule tip increases as the free subunit concentration increases. These data are consistent with a two-dimensional model for microtubule assembly, and are explained by a shift in microtubule tip structure from a relatively blunt shape at low free concentrations to relatively tapered at high free concentrations. We find that because both the association and the dissociation rates increase at higher free subunit concentrations, the kinetics of microtubule assembly are an order-of-magnitude higher than currently estimated in the literature. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Heterodimers composed of GTP-bound $\alpha$- and $\beta$-tubulin molecules polymerize to form microtubule protofilaments, which associate laterally to form a hollow microtubule. Tubulin has GTPase activity and the GTP molecules associated with $\beta$-tubulin molecules are hydrolyzed shortly after being incorporated into the polymerizing microtubules. GTP hydrolysis alters the conformation of the tubulin molecules and drives the dynamic behavior of microtubules. Periods of rapid microtubule polymerization alternate with periods of shrinkage in a process known as dynamic instability. In plants, dynamic instability plays a key role in determining the organization of microtubules into arrays, and these arrays vary throughout the cell cycle. In this review, we describe the mechanisms that regulate microtubule dynamics and underlie dynamic instability, and discuss how dynamic instability may shape microtubule organization in plant cells.},

Here we show that two well-studied plus-end-binding proteins-end-tracking protein EB1 and microtubule polymerase XMAP215-act together to strongly promote microtubule growth to cellular rates. Unexpectedly, the combined effects of XMAP215 and EB1 are highly synergistic, with acceleration of growth well beyond the product of the individual effects of either protein. The synergistic growth promotion does not rely on any of the canonical EB1 interactions, suggesting an allosteric interaction through the microtubule end. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that taxol and XMAP215, which have non-overlapping binding sites on tubulin, also act synergistically on growth. The increase in growth rates is accompanied by a strong enhancement of microtubule catastrophe by EB1, thereby rendering the fast and dynamic microtubule behaviour typically observed in cells.},

In cooperation with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), MTs form bundles endowing cells with specific mechanisms to control their shape or generate forces. Whether the dynamics of MTs is affected by the lateral connections that MAPs make between MTs during bundle formation is still under debate. Using in vitro reconstitution of MT bundling, we analyzed the dynamics of MT bundles generated by two plant MAP65 (MAP65-1/4), MAP65-1 being the plant ortholog of vertebrate PRC1 and yeast Ase1. MAP65-1/4 limit the amplitude of MT bundle depolymerization and increase the elongation phases. The subsequent sustained elongation of bundles is governed by the coordination of MT growth, so that MT ends come in close vicinity. We develop a model based on the assumption that both MAP65-1/4 block MT depolymerization. Model simulations reveal that rescue frequencies are higher between parallel than between anti-parallel MTs. In consequence the polarity of bundled MTs by MAP65 controls the amplitude of bundle's growth. Our results illustrate how MAP-induced MT-bundling, which is finely tuned by MT polarity, robustly coordinates MT elongation within bundles.},

@article{Hyman1992,
  abstract        = {The role of GTP hydrolysis in microtubule dynamics has been reinvestigated using an analogue of GTP, guanylyl-(alpha, beta)-methylene-diphosphonate (GMPCPP). This analogue binds to the tubulin exchangeable nucleotide binding site (E-site) with an affinity four to eightfold lower than GTP and promotes the polymerization of normal microtubules. The polymerization rate of microtubules with GMPCPP-tubulin is very similar to that of GTP-tubulin. However, in contrast to microtubules polymerized with GTP, GMPCPP-microtubules do not depolymerize rapidly after isothermal dilution. The depolymerization rate of GMPCPP-microtubules is 0.1 s-1 compared with 500 s-1 for GDP-microtubules. GMPCPP also completely suppresses dynamic instability. Contrary to previous work, we find that the beta--gamma bond of GMPCPP is hydrolyzed extremely slowly after incorporation into the microtubule lattice, with a rate constant of 4 x 10(-7) s-1. Because GMPCPP hydrolysis is negligible over the course of a polymerization experiment, it can be used to test the role of hydrolysis in microtubule dynamics. Our results provide strong new evidence for the idea that GTP hydrolysis by tubulin is not required for normal polymerization but is essential for depolymerization and thus for dynamic instability. Because GMPCPP strongly promotes spontaneous nucleation of microtubules, we propose that GTP hydrolysis by tubulin also plays the important biological role of inhibiting spontaneous microtubule nucleation.},

  abstract        = {Microtubules (MTs) are hollow cytoskeletal filaments assembled from $\alpha$$\beta$-tubulin heterodimers. Tau, an unstructured protein found in neuronal axons, binds to MTs and regulates their dynamics. Aberrant Tau behavior is associated with neurodegenerative dementias, including Alzheimer's. Here, we report on a direct force measurement between paclitaxel-stabilized MTs coated with distinct Tau isoforms by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of MT-Tau mixtures under osmotic pressure (P). In going from bare MTs to MTs with Tau coverage near the physiological submonolayer regime (Tau/tubulin-dimer molar ratio; $\Phi$Tau = 1/10), isoforms with longer N-terminal tails (NTTs) sterically stabilized MTs, preventing bundling up to PB ∼ 10,000-20,000 Pa, an order of magnitude larger than bare MTs. Tau with short NTTs showed little additional effect in suppressing the bundling pressure (PB ∼ 1,000-2,000 Pa) over the same range. Remarkably, the abrupt increase in PB observed for longer isoforms suggests a mushroom to brush transition occurring at 1/13 {\textless} $\Phi$Tau {\textless} 1/10, which corresponds to MT-bound Tau with NTTs that are considerably more extended than SAXS data for Tau in solution indicate. Modeling of Tau-mediated MT-MT interactions supports the hypothesis that longer NTTs transition to a polyelectrolyte brush at higher coverages. Higher pressures resulted in isoform-independent irreversible bundling because the polyampholytic nature of Tau leads to short-range attractions. These findings suggest an isoform-dependent biological role for regulation by Tau, with longer isoforms conferring MT steric stabilization against aggregation either with other biomacromolecules or into tight bundles, preventing loss of function in the crowded axon environment.},

  abstract        = {The study of molecular evolution at the level of protein-coding genes often entails comparing large datasets of sequences to infer their evolutionary relationships. Despite the importance of a protein's structure and conformational dynamics to its function and thus its fitness, common phylogenetic methods embody minimal biophysical knowledge of proteins. To underscore the biophysical constraints on natural selection, we survey effects of protein mutations, highlighting the physical basis for marginal stability of natural globular proteins and how requirement for kinetic stability and avoidance of misfolding and misinteractions might have affected protein evolution. The biophysical underpinnings of these effects have been addressed by models with an explicit coarse-grained spatial representation of the polypeptide chain. Sequence-structure mappings based on such models are powerful conceptual tools that rationalize mutational robustness, evolvability, epistasis, promiscuous function performed by 'hidden' conformational states, resolution of adaptive conflicts and conformational switches in the evolution from one protein fold to another. Recently, protein biophysics has been applied to derive more accurate evolutionary accounts of sequence data. Methods have also been developed to exploit sequence-based evolutionary information to predict biophysical behaviours of proteins. The success of these approaches demonstrates a deep synergy between the fields of protein biophysics and protein evolution.},

  abstract        = {The study of balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons has led to several open questions. On the one hand it is yet unclear whether the asynchronous state observed in the brain is autonomously generated, or if it results from the interplay between external drivings and internal dynamics. It is also not known, which kind of network variabilities will lead to irregular spiking and which to synchronous firing states. Here we show how isolated networks of purely excitatory neurons generically show asynchronous firing whenever a minimal level of structural variability is present together with a refractory period. Our autonomous networks are composed of excitable units, in the form of leaky integrators spiking only in response to driving currents, remaining otherwise quiet. For a non-uniform network, composed exclusively of excitatory neurons, we find a rich repertoire of self-induced dynamical states. We show in particular that asynchronous drifting states may be stabilized in purely excitatory networks whenever a refractory period is present. Other states found are either fully synchronized or mixed, containing both drifting and synchronized components. The individual neurons considered are excitable and hence do not dispose of intrinsic natural firing frequencies. An effective network-wide distribution of natural frequencies is however generated autonomously through self-consistent feedback loops. The asynchronous drifting state is, additionally, amenable to an analytic solution. We find two types of asynchronous activity, with the individual neurons spiking regularly in the pure drifting state, albeit with a continuous distribution of firing frequencies. The activity of the drifting component, however, becomes irregular in the mixed state, due to the periodic driving of the synchronized component. We propose a new tool for the study of chaos in spiking neural networks, which consists of an analysis of the time series of pairs of consecutive interspike intervals. In this space, we show that a strange attractor with a fractal dimension of about 1.8 is formed in the mentioned mixed state.},

The core of a cell's internal organization lies with the cytoskeleton made of both microtubule and actin filaments with their associated proteins and ATP-utilizing enzymes. Despite years of in vitro reconstitution experiments, we still do not fully understand how the cytoskeleton can self-organize. In an attempt to create a simple system of self-organization, we have used a simple filament-gliding assay to examine how kinesin-1-driven motion of microtubules can generate cell-like organization in the presence of excess filaments and antiparallel cross-linkers.},

  abstract        = {When microtubules, ordinarily quite rigid structures, are treated in vitro with the anti-tumor drug taxol, they rapidly develop a wavy appearance and become strikingly flexible. A quantitative measure of their flexibility, the reciprocal statistical length, lambda, increases by an order of magnitude when taxol is bound. Subsequent addition of either of the microtubule-associated proteins MAP-2 or tau causes the flexibility to disappear. It can be restored again by removing the microtubule-associated protein. These results show that taxol changes microtubular structure substantially, probably by weakening the interactions between protofilaments, and that microtubule-associated proteins reverse these effects, possibly by bridging protofilaments. This structural change and the accompanying flexibility may contribute importantly to taxol's cytotoxic activity.},

Here, we report a human lesion study (n = 145) that investigates the neural mechanisms underlying discourse comprehension (measured by the Discourse Comprehension Test) and systematically examine its relation to a broad range of psychological factors, including psychometric intelligence (measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), emotional intelligence (measured by the Mayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test), and personality traits (measured by the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality Inventory). Scores obtained from these factors were submitted to voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to elucidate their neural substrates. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that working memory and extraversion reliably predict individual differences in discourse comprehension: higher working memory scores and lower extraversion levels predict better discourse comprehension performance. Lesion mapping results indicated that these convergent variables depend on a shared network of frontal and parietal regions, including white matter association tracts that bind these areas into a coordinated system. The observed findings motivate an integrative framework for understanding the neural foundations of discourse comprehension, suggesting that core elements of discourse processing emerge from a distributed network of brain regions that support specific competencies for executive and social function.},

To find candidate targets, we used a combination of photolabeling, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry to identify halothane-binding targets in rat neuronal membranes. Of the 265 spots detected on the two-dimensional gels, 90 were labeled by [(14)C]halothane, and 34 were identified. Mitochondrial proteins, especially respiratory complex and voltage-dependent anion channels, dominated the labeled group, and there were several examples of subunit- and state-dependent binding. A significant correlation was found between internal protein cavities and binding in a group of proteins with high resolution structures. Therefore, in addition to identifying novel neuronal targets, these data suggest a general molecular feature, the buried cavity, as a dominant attribute of volatile anesthetic-binding sites found in a limited number of neuronal membrane proteins.},

Recent work suggests that political ideology also has a heritable component, but no specific gene variant associated with political ideology has so far been identified. In this article we hypothesize that individuals with a genetic predisposition towards seeking out new experiences will tend to be more liberal, but only if they are embedded in a social context that provides them with multiple points of view. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we test this hypothesis by investigating an association between self-reported political ideology and the 7R variant of the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4), which has previously been associated with novelty-seeking. We find that the number of friendships a person has in adolescence is significantly associated with liberal political ideology among those with DRD4-7R. Among those without the gene variant there is no association. This is the first study ever to elaborate a specific gene-environment interaction that contributes to ideological self-identification, and it highlights the importance of incorporating both nature and nurture into the study of politics.},

Previously, it was shown that Tau, a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) localized to neuronal axons, regulates the average number of PFs in microtubules with increasing inner radius {\textless} RinMT {\textgreater} observed for increasing Tau/tubulin-dimer molar ratio $\Phi$Tau at paclitaxel/tubulin-dimer molar ratio $\Lambda$Ptxl = 1/1. Methods We report a synchrotron SAXS and TEM study of the phase behavior of microtubules as a function of varying concentrations of paclitaxel (1/32 ≤ $\Lambda$Ptxl ≤ 1/4) and Tau (human isoform 3RS, 0 ≤ $\Phi$3RS ≤ 1/2) at room temperature. Results Tau and paclitaxel have opposing regulatory effects on microtubule bundling architectures and microtubule diameter. Surprisingly and in contrast to previous results at $\Lambda$Ptxl = 1/1 where microtubule bundles are absent, in the lower paclitaxel concentration regime ($\Lambda$Ptxl ≤ 1/4), we observe both microtubule doublets and triplets with increasing Tau. Furthermore, increasing paclitaxel concentration (up to $\Lambda$Ptxl = 1/1) slightly decreased the average microtubule diameter (by {\~{}} 1 PF) while increasing Tau concentration (up to $\Phi$3RS = 1/2) significantly increased the diameter (by {\~{}} 2–3 PFs). Conclusions The suppression of Tau-mediated microtubule bundling with increasing paclitaxel is consistent with paclitaxel seeding more, but shorter, microtubules by rapidly exhausting tubulin available for polymerization. Microtubule bundles require the aggregate Tau-Tau attractions along the microtubule length to overcome individual microtubule thermal energies disrupting bundles. General significance Investigating MAP-mediated interactions between microtubules (as it relates to in vivo behavior) requires the elimination or minimization of paclitaxel.},

  abstract        = {Interactions between dynamic microtubules and actin filaments are essential to a wide range of cell biological processes including cell division, motility and morphogenesis. In neuronal growth cones, interactions between microtubules and actin filaments in filopodia are necessary for growth cones to make a turn. Growth-cone turning is a fundamental behaviour during axon guidance, as correct navigation of the growth cone through the embryo is required for it to locate an appropriate synaptic partner. Microtubule-actin filament interactions also occur in the transition zone and central domain of the growth cone, where actin arcs exert compressive forces to corral microtubules into the core of the growth cone and thereby facilitate microtubule bundling, a requirement for axon formation. We now have a fairly comprehensive understanding of the dynamic behaviour of the cytoskeleton in growth cones, and the stage is set for discovering the molecular machinery that enables microtubule-actin filament coupling in growth cones, as well as the intracellular signalling pathways that regulate these interactions. Furthermore, recent experiments suggest that microtubule-actin filament interactions might also be important for the formation of dendritic spines from filopodia in mature neurons. Therefore, the mechanisms coupling microtubules to actin filaments in growth-cone turning and dendritic-spine maturation might be conserved.},

Assuming a weak perturbation by the advection term and using projection method, in a second step, an equation of motion for traveling waves within such tubes can be derived. Both methods predict properly the nonlinear dependence of the propagation velocity on the ratio of the modulation period of the geometry to the intrinsic width of the front, or pulse. As a main feature, we observe finite intervals of propagation failure of waves induced by the tube's modulation and derive an analytically tractable condition for their occurrence. For the highly diffusive limit, using the Fick-Jacobs approach, we show that wave velocities within modulated tubes are governed by an effective diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of a single bottleneck on the period of pulse trains. We observe period changes by integer fractions dependent on the bottleneck width and the period of the entering pulse train.},

  abstract        = {Finding new materials with targeted properties has traditionally been guided by intuition, and trial and error. With increasing chemical complexity, the combinatorial possibilities are too large for an Edisonian approach to be practical. Here we show how an adaptive design strategy, tightly coupled with experiments, can accelerate the discovery process by sequentially identifying the next experiments or calculations, to effectively navigate$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe complex search space. Our strategy uses inference and global optimization to balance the$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntrade-off between exploitation and exploration of the search space. We demonstrate this by finding very low thermal hysteresis (DT) NiTi-based shape memory alloys, with Ti50.0Ni46.7Cu0.8Fe2.3Pd0.2 possessing the smallest DT (1.84 K). We synthesize and characterize 36 predicted compositions (9 feedback loops) from a potential space of B800,000 compositions. Of these, 14 had smaller DT than any of the 22 in the original data set.},

  abstract        = {Within cells, motor and non-motor microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) simultaneously converge on the microtubule. How the binding activities of non-motor MAPs are coordinated and how they contribute to the balance and distribution of motor transport is unknown. Here, we examine the relationship between MAP7 and tau owing to their antagonistic roles in vivo. We find that MAP7 and tau compete for binding to microtubules, and determine a mechanism by which MAP7 displaces tau from the lattice. MAP7 promotes kinesin-based transport in vivo and strongly recruits kinesin-1 to the microtubule in vitro, providing evidence for direct enhancement of motor motility by a MAP. Both MAP7 and tau strongly inhibit kinesin-3 and have no effect on cytoplasmic dynein, demonstrating that MAPs differentially control distinct classes of motors. Overall, these results reveal a general principle for how MAP competition dictates access to the microtubule to determine the correct distribution and balance of motor activity.},

  abstract        = {Members of the kinesin-8 motor class have the remarkable ability to both walk towards microtubule plus-ends and depolymerise these ends on arrival, thereby regulating microtubule length. To analyse how kinesin-8 multitasks, we studied the structure and function of the kinesin-8 motor domain. We determined the first crystal structure of a kinesin-8 and used cryo-electron microscopy to calculate the structure of the microtubule-bound motor. Microtubule-bound kinesin-8 reveals a new conformation compared with the crystal structure, including a bent conformation of the $\alpha$4 relay helix and ordering of functionally important loops. The kinesin-8 motor domain does not depolymerise stabilised microtubules with ATP but does form tubulin rings in the presence of a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue. This shows that, by collaborating, kinesin-8 motor domain molecules can release tubulin from microtubules, and that they have a similar mechanical effect on microtubule ends as kinesin-13, which enables depolymerisation. Our data reveal aspects of the molecular mechanism of kinesin-8 motors that contribute to their unique dual motile and depolymerising functions, which are adapted to control microtubule length.},

  abstract        = {Synaptic plasticity is thought to induce memory traces in the brain that are the foundation of learning. To ensure the stability of these traces in the presence of further learning, however, a regulation of plasticity appears beneficial. Here, we take up the recent suggestion that dendritic inhibition can switch plasticity of excitatory synapses on and off by gating backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) and calcium spikes, i.e., by gating the coincidence signals required for Hebbian forms of plasticity. We analyze temporal and spatial constraints of such a gating and investigate whether it is possible to suppress bAPs without a simultaneous annihilation of the forward-directed information flow via excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). In a computational analysis of conductance-based multi-compartmental models, we demonstrate that a robust control of bAPs and calcium spikes is possible in an all-or-none manner, enabling a binary switch of coincidence signals and plasticity. The position of inhibitory synapses on the dendritic tree determines the spatial extent of the effect and allows a pathway-specific regulation of plasticity. With appropriate timing, EPSPs can still trigger somatic action potentials, although backpropagating signals are abolished. An annihilation of bAPs requires precisely timed inhibition, while the timing constraints are less stringent for distal calcium spikes. We further show that a wide-spread motif of local circuits-feedforward inhibition-is well suited to provide the temporal precision needed for the control of bAPs. Altogether, our model provides experimentally testable predictions and demonstrates that the inhibitory switch of plasticity can be a robust and attractive mechanism, hence assigning an additional function to the inhibitory elements of neuronal microcircuits beyond modulation of excitability.},

In this paper, we focus upon content analysis, which is a technique often used to analyze transcripts of asynchronous, computer mediated discussion groups in formal educational settings. Although this research technique is often used, standards are not yet established. The applied instruments reflect a wide variety of approaches and differ in their level of detail and the type of analysis categories used. Further differences are related to a diversity in their theoretical base, the amount of information about validity and reliability, and the choice for the unit of analysis. This article presents an overview of different content analysis instruments, building on a sample of models commonly used in the CSCL-literature. The discussion of 15 instruments results in a number of critical conclusions. There are questions about the coherence between the theoretical base and the operational translation of the theory in the instruments. Instruments are hardly compared or contrasted with one another. As a consequence the empirical base of the validity of the instruments is limited. The analysis is rather critical when it comes to the issue of reliability. The authors put forward the need to improve the theoretical and empirical base of the existing instruments in order to promote the overall quality of CSCL-research. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract        = {Tau, as a microtubule (MT)-associated protein, participates in key neuronal functions such as the regulation of MT dynamics, axonal transport, and neurite outgrowth. Alternative splicing of exon 10 in the tau primary transcript gives rise to protein isoforms with three (3R) or four (4R) MT binding repeats. Although tau isoforms are balanced in the normal adult human brain, imbalances in 3R:4R ratio have been tightly associated with the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Several studies exploiting tau overexpression and/or mutations suggested that perturbations in tau metabolism impair axonal transport. Nevertheless, no physiological model has yet demonstrated the consequences of altering the endogenous relative content of tau isoforms over axonal transport regulation. Here, we addressed this issue using a trans-splicing strategy that allows modulating tau exon 10 inclusion/exclusion in differentiated human-derived neurons. Upon changes in 3R:4R tau relative content, neurons showed no morphological changes, but live imaging studies revealed that the dynamics of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) were significantly impaired. Single trajectory analyses of the moving vesicles showed that predominance of 3R tau favored the anterograde movement of APP vesicles, increasing anterograde run lengths and reducing retrograde runs and segmental velocities. Conversely, the imbalance toward the 4R isoform promoted a retrograde bias by a significant reduction of anterograde velocities. These findings suggest that changes in 3R:4R tau ratio has an impact on the regulation of axonal transport and specifically in APP dynamics, which might link tau isoform imbalances with APP abnormal metabolism in neurodegenerative processes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The tau protein has a relevant role in the transport of cargos throughout neurons. Dysfunction in tau metabolism underlies several neurological disorders leading to dementia. In the adult human brain, two tau isoforms are found in equal amounts, whereas changes in such equilibrium have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the role of tau in human neurons in culture and found that perturbations in the endogenous balance of tau isoforms were sufficient to impair the transport of the Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid precursor protein (APP), although neuronal morphology was normal. Our results provide evidence of a direct relationship between tau isoform imbalance and defects in axonal transport, which induce an abnormal APP metabolism with important implications in neurodegeneration.},

We used neuroimaging to investigate the neural systems involved in maintaining belief in the face of counterevidence, presenting 40 liberals with arguments that contradicted their strongly held political and non-political views. Challenges to political beliefs produced increased activity in the default mode network—a set of interconnected structures associated with self-representation and disengagement from the external world. Trials with greater belief resistance showed increased response in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and decreased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex. We also found that participants who changed their minds more showed less BOLD signal in the insula and the amygdala when evaluating counterevidence. These results highlight the role of emotion in belief-change resistance and offer insight into the neural systems involved in belief maintenance, motivated reasoning, and related phenomena.},

Apart from the end, the microtubule shaft is not considered 25 to be dynamic. However recent evidence suggests that free dimers can be incorporated into the 26 shaft of a microtubule damaged by mechanical stress. Here we explored whether dimer exchange 27 was a core property of the microtubule lattice independently of any external constraint. We found 28 that dimers can be removed from and incorporated into the lattice at sites along the microtubule 29 shaft. Furthermore, we showed by experiment and by modeling that rapid dimer renewal requires 30 structural defects in the lattice, which occur in fast growing microtubules. Hence long-lived 31 microtubules have the capacity to self-renew despite their apparent stability and thereby can 32 potentially regulate signaling pathways and structural rearrangements associated with tubulin-33 dimer exchange at sites along their entire length.},

  abstract        = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of "primary states" is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit "criticality," i.e., the property of being poised at a "critical" point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state.},

Within the growth cone, extracellular guidance cues are interpreted and then transduced into physical changes in the actin filament (F-actin) and microtubule cytoskeletons, providing direction and movement. While both cytoskeletal networks individually possess important growth cone-specific functions, recent data over the past several years point towards a more cooperative role between the two systems. Facilitating this interaction between F-actin and microtubules, microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) have been shown to link the two cytoskeletons together. Evidence suggests that many +TIPs can couple microtubules to F-actin dynamics, supporting both microtubule advance and retraction in the growth cone periphery. In addition, growing in vitro and in vivo data support a secondary role for +TIPs in which they may participate as F-actin nucleators, thus directly influencing F-actin dynamics and organization. This review focuses on how +TIPs may link F-actin and microtubules together in the growth cone, and how these interactions may influence axon guidance. This article is protected by copyright.

Beginning with a simple example of an everyday argument, we present an analysis of it visualized as an argument diagram constructed using a software tool. In the context of a brief history of the development of diagramming, it is then shown how argument diagrams have been used to analyse and work with argumentation in law, philosophy and AI.},

  abstract        = {Self-organization in cells often manifests itself in oscillations and waves. Here, we address deformation waves in protoplasmic droplets of the plasmodial slime mould Physarum polycephalum by modelling and experiments. In particular, we extend a one-dimensional model that considered the cell as a poroelastic medium, where active tension caused mechanochemical waves that were regulated by an inhibitor (Radszuweit et al., 2013). Our extension consists of a simple, qualitative chemical reaction-diffusion model (Brusselator) that describes the regulation of the inhibitor by another biochemical species. The biochemical reaction enhances the formation of mechanochemical waves if the reaction rates and input concentrations are near or inside an oscillatory regime. The period of the waves is found to be controlled by the characteristic oscillation period, whereas their wavelength is set by mechanical parameters. The model also allows for a systematic study of the chemical activity at the onset of mechanochemical waves. We also present examples for pattern formation in protoplasmic droplets of Physarum polycephalum including global oscillations where the central region of the droplets is in antiphase to the boundary zone, as well as travelling and standing wave-like uniaxial patterns. Finally, we apply our model to reproduce these experimental results by identifying the active tension inhibitor with the intracellular calcium concentration in the Physarum droplets and by using parameter values from mechanical experiments, respectively knowledge about the properties of calcium oscillations in Physarum. The simulation results are then found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations.},

  abstract        = {The electrostatic contribution to the free energy of folding was calculated for 21 salt bridges in 9 protein X-ray crystal structures using a continuum electrostatic approach with the DELPHI computer-program package. The majority (17) were found to be electrostatically destabilizing; the average free energy change, which is analogous to mutation of salt bridging side chains to hydrophobic isosteres, was calculated to be 3.5 kcal/mol. This is fundamentally different from stability measurements using pK(alpha) shifts, which effectively measure the strength of a salt bridge relative to 1 or more charged hydrogen bonds. The calculated effect was due to a large, unfavorable desolvation contribution that was not fully compensated by favorable interactions within the salt bridge and between salt-bridge partners and other polar and charged groups in the folded protein. Some of the salt bridges were studied in further detail to determine the effect of the choice of values for atomic radii, internal protein dielectric constant, and ionic strength used in the calculations. Increased ionic strength resulted in little or no change in calculated stability for 3 of 4 salt bridges over a range of 0.1-0.9 M. The results suggest that mutation of salt bridges, particularly those that are buried, to `'hydrophobic bridges'' (that pack at least as well as wild type) can result in proteins with increased stability. Due to the large penalty for burying uncompensated ionizable groups, salt bridges could help to limit the number of low free energy conformations of a molecule or complex and thus play a role in determining specificity (i.e., the uniqueness of a protein fold or protein-ligand binding geometry).},

One natural idea is that technologies developed specifically for improving deliberation might help improve in quantity and quality the public deliberation required for a healthy democracy. To date, this has failed to happen; deliberation technologies have not been taken up by the public to any significant degree. I suggest that this is because such technologies have taken the wrong approach, imposing too much structure on deliberative discourse. An alternative is to "cultivate" better deliberation. This approach is taken by YourView, a new kind of virtual forum, which aims to enhance democracy by providing an opportunity for citizens easily access key arguments on major issues, take a stand on those issues, and help shape the "collective wisdom" - the considered collective view. By identifying when participants exhibit "epistemic virtues," and rewarding such behaviors, it encourages rather than imposes better-quality deliberation.},

  abstract        = {Biological time, Symmetries and Singularities Morphogenesis Series: Lecture Notes in Morphogenesis This authored monograph introduces a genuinely theoretical approach to biology. Starting point is the investigation of empirical biological scaling including their variability, which is found in the literature, e.g. allometric relationships, fractals, etc. The book then analyzes two different aspects of biological time: first, a supplementary temporal dimension to accommodate proper biological rhythms; secondly, the concepts of protension and retention as a means of local organization of time in living organisms. Moreover, the book investigates the role of symmetry in biology, in view of its ubiquitous importance in physics. In relation with the notion of extended critical transitions, the book proposes that organisms and their evolution can be characterized by continued symmetry changes, which accounts for the irreducibility of their historicity and variability. The authors also introduce the concept of anti-entropy as a measure for the potential of variability, being equally understood as alterations in symmetry. By this, the book provides a mathematical account of Gould's analysis of phenotypic complexity with respect to biological evolution. The target audience primarily comprises researchers interested in new theoretical approaches to biology, from physical, biological or philosophical backgrounds, but the book may also be beneficial for graduate students who want to enter this field.},

Connections are presented between already recognized patterns of play and recent research on the brain (in particular, the limbic system). By providing a framework for understanding how the brain responds to recurrent patterns inherent to play, we aim to provide a platform for future experimental player-game interaction research (for which possible directions are briefly explored), and a propaedeutic to biologically-grounded player satisfaction models.},

However, the molecular mechanism used by Ensconsin to activate Kinesin-1 remains elusive. Ensconsin/ MAP7 contains an N-terminal microtubule-binding domain (MBD) and a C-terminal Kinesin-binding domain (KBD). Using rescue experiments in live flies, we show that KBD expression alone is sufficient to restore the correct localization patterns of Staufen and Gurken proteins in oocytes. Moreover, in neural stem cells, this domain is also sufficient to fully rescue Ensconsin-dependent centrosome separation defects. Therefore, we propose that the KBD/Kinesin-1 motor represents a minimal activation module that is sufficient to promote Kinesin-1 activation in most Drosophila cells. Nonetheless, our data also suggest that in a very large cell with a complex microtubule network, this minimal module is not sufficient for optimal Kinesin-1 function that requires direct targeting of Kinesin-1 to microtubules by Ensconsin.},

Exploiting the high temporal resolution of the chamber, we exposed synapses to “spaced” or “massed” application of glutamate and then examined levels of pCREB in somata.

We combined single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy to show that the elemental step in microtubule severing is the generation of nanoscale damage throughout the microtubule by active extraction of tubulin heterodimers. These damage sites are repaired spontaneously by guanosine triphosphate (GTP)–tubulin incorporation, which rejuvenates and stabilizes the microtubule shaft. Consequently, spastin and katanin increase microtubule rescue rates. Furthermore, newly severed ends emerge with a high density of GTP-tubulin that protects them against depolymerization. The stabilization of the newly severed plus ends and the higher rescue frequency synergize to amplify microtubule number and mass. Thus, severing enzymes regulate microtubule architecture and dynamics by promoting GTP-tubulin incorporation within the microtubule shaft.},

As a tool for promoting conversational modes of learning, it has been suggested that online discussion forums can lead to enhanced learning outcomes for students. However, there is a need to explore further the implications of the highly mediated nature of computer–based interaction on student learning within these virtual learning environments. This paper presents results from a detailed study of students' learning outcomes and patterns of interaction within an online discussion forum. The findings suggest that the typical nonlinear branching structure of online discussion may be insufficient for the realisation of truly conversational modes of learning.

                     and potentialist alternatives. I will argue that a naturalistic notion
                     of ontological emergence can only succeed if we explicitly refuse the
                     atomistic fundamental ontological postulate that asserts that every
                     entity is endowed with a set of absolutely intrinsic properties, being
                     qualitatively immutable through its extrinsic relations. Furthermore, it
                     will be shown that, ironically enough, this metaphysical assumption is
                     implicitly shared by all the above mentioned alternatives to
                     Emergentism. The current article concludes that the notion of
                     organization by itself is not enough, and that ontological emergence can
                     only be justified by assuming a relational ontological perspective that,

Cognitive decline associated with aging, and white matter connectivity degradation as a biological substrate for that decline, is then described. We then briefly describe the technology of DTI as a means for in vivo, non-invasive interrogation of white matter connectivity, and relate it to FLAIR, a more traditional MRI method for assessing white matter injury. We then survey the existing findings on relationships between aging-associated neuropathological processes and DTI measurements on one hand; and relationships between DTI measurements and late-life cognitive function on the other. We conclude with a summary of current research directions in relation to DTI studies of cognitive aging.},

Selves incorporate the patterning of their various environments and thus confer particular and culture-specific form and function to the psychological processes they organize (e.g., attention, perception, cognition, emotion, motivation, interpersonal relationship, group). In turn, as selves engage with their sociocultural contexts, they reinforce and sometimes change the ideas, practices, and institutions of these environments.},

But on the other hand, the more sensible proposals – sensible in the sense of being both practically achievable and more plausibly ethically justifiable – can be rather hard to distinguish from both traditional forms of moral enhancement, such as non-drug-mediated social or moral education, and non-moral forms of bioenhancement, such as smart-drug style cognitive enhancement.

We discuss how the interplay between active transport along a network and infinite diffusion in a bulk reservoir leads to a heterogeneous matter distribution on various scales. We find three regimes for steady state transport, corresponding to the scale of the network, of individual segments or local to sites. At low exchange rates strong density heterogeneities develop between different segments in the network. In this regime one has to consider the topological complexity of the whole network to describe transport. In contrast, at moderate exchange rates the transport through the network decouples, and the physics is determined by single segments and the local topology. At last, for very high exchange rates the homogeneous Langmuir process dominates the stationary state. We introduce effective rate diagrams for the network to identify these different regimes. Based on this method we develop an intuitive but generic picture of how the stationary state of excluded volume processes on complex networks can be understood in terms of the single-segment phase diagram.},

To test this hypothesis, we developed an experimental system where MAPs are electrostatically end-attached to a flat surface, such that the projection domains extend away from the surface. Atomic force microscopy force measurements on this system show that projection domains exert a long-range ( {\textgreater} 100 nm) repulsive force.

  abstract        = {Author Summary$\backslash$nSystems in a critical state are poised on the cusp of a transition between ordered and random behavior. At this point, they demonstrate complex patterning of fluctuations at all scales of space and time. Criticality is an attractive model for brain dynamics because it optimizes information transfer, storage capacity, and sensitivity to external stimuli in computational models. However, to date there has been little direct experimental evidence for critical dynamics of human brain networks. Here, we considered two measures of functional coupling or phase synchronization between components of a dynamic system: the phase lock interval or duration of synchronization between a specific pair of time series or processes in the system and the lability of global synchronization among all pairs of processes. We confirmed that both synchronization metrics demonstrated scale invariant behaviors in two computational models of critical dynamics as well as in human brain functional systems oscillating at low frequencies ({\textless}0.5 Hz, measured using functional MRI) and at higher frequencies (1–125 Hz, measured using magnetoencephalography). We conclude that human brain functional networks demonstrate critical dynamics in all frequency intervals, a phenomenon we have described as broadband criticality.},

  abstract        = {Motility is a fundamentally important property of most members of the kinesin superfamily, but a rare subset of kinesins are also able to alter microtubule dynamics. At kinetochore-microtubule plus ends, the kinesin-8 family member Kif18A is essential to align mitotic chromosomes at the spindle equator during cell division, but how it accomplishes this function is unclear. We report here that Kif18A is a plus-end-directed motor that inhibits the polymerization dynamics of microtubule plus ends without destabilizing them, distinguishing Kif18A from the budding yeast ortholog Kip3. In interphase cells, Kif18A uses this activity to reduce the overall dynamicity of microtubule plus ends and effectively constrains the distance over which plus ends grow and shrink. Our findings suggest that kinesin-8 family members have developed biochemically distinct activities throughout evolution and have implications for how Kif18A affects kinetochore-microtubule plus-end dynamics during mitosis in animal cells. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Rearrangements are important for the creation of molecular biodiversity and for functional molecular changes which underlie developmental shifts in the bauplan of organisms. Here we review the mechanisms by which new arrangements arise and the potential benefits of rearrangements. We concentrate on how new domains emerge and why they rapidly spread across genomes, gaining higher copy numbers than older, more established domains. This spread is most likely a consequence of their high adaptive potential but is unlikely to make up on its own for the drastic loss of domains, which is observed across different taxa. We show that a significant portion of the recently emerged domains, especially those in multidomain families, are highly disordered and speculate about the significance of these findings for the evolvability of novel genetic material. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {The nature of consciousness, the mechanism by which it occurs in the brain, and its ultimate place in the universe are unknown. We proposed in the mid 1990ʼs that consciousness depends on biologically ‘orchestrated' coherent quantum processes in collections of microtubules within brain neurons, that these quantum processes correlate with, and regulate, neuronal synaptic and membrane activity, and that the continuous Schr{\"{o}}dinger evolution of each such process terminates in accordance with the specific Di{\'{o}}si–Penrose (DP) scheme of ‘objective reduction' (‘OR') of the quantum state. This orchestrated OR activity (‘Orch OR') is taken to result in moments of conscious awareness and/or choice. The DP form of OR is related to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and space–time geometry, so Orch OR suggests that there is a connection between the brainʼs biomolecular processes and the basic structure of the universe. Here we review Orch OR in light of criticisms and developments in quantum biology, neuroscience, physics and cosmology. We also introduce a novel suggestion of ‘beat frequencies' of faster microtubule vibrations as a possible source of the observed electro-encephalographic (‘EEG') correlates of consciousness. We conclude that consciousness plays an intrinsic role in the universe.},

  abstract        = {Kinesin-8 motors regulate the size of microtubule structures, using length-dependent accumulation at the plus end to preferentially disassemble long microtubules. Despite extensive study, the kinesin-8 depolymerase mechanism remains under debate. Here, we provide evidence for an alternative, tubulin curvature-sensing model of microtubule depolymerization by the budding yeast kinesin-8, Kip3. Kinesin-8/Kip3 uses ATP hydrolysis, like other kinesins, for stepping on the microtubule lattice, but at the plus end Kip3 undergoes a switch: its ATPase activity is suppressed when it binds tightly to the curved conformation of tubulin. This prolongs plus-end binding, stabilizes protofilament curvature, and ultimately promotes microtubule disassembly. The tubulin curvature-sensing model is supported by our identification of Kip3 structural elements necessary and sufficient for plus-end binding and depolymerase activity, as well as by the identification of an $\alpha$-tubulin residue specifically required for the Kip3-curved tubulin interaction. Together, these findings elucidate a major regulatory mechanism controlling the size of cellular microtubule structures.},

We study the problem of how multiple such judgments can be aggregated. We define the problem by adapting various classical social-choice-theoretic properties for the argumentation domain. We show that while argument-wise plurality voting satisfies many properties, it fails to guarantee the collective rationality of the outcome, and struggles with ties. We then present more general results, proving multiple impossibility results on the existence of any good aggregation operator. After characterising the sufficient and necessary conditions for satisfying collective rationality, we study whether restricting the domain of argument-wise plurality voting to classical semantics allows us to escape the impossibility result. We close by listing graph-theoretic restrictions under which argument-wise plurality rule does produce collectively rational outcomes. In addition to identifying fundamental barriers to collective argument evaluation, our results open up the door for a new research agenda for the argumentation and computational social choice communities.},

  abstract        = {The proponents of cyberspace promise that online discourse will increase political participation and pave the road for a democratic utopia. This article explores the potential for civil discourse in cyberspace by examining the level of civility in 287 discussion threads in political newsgroups. While scholars often use civility and politeness interchangeably, this study argues that this conflation ignores the democratic merit of robust and heated discussion. Therefore, civility was defined in a broader sense, by identifying as civil behaviors that enhance democratic conversation. In support of this distinction, the study results revealed that most messages posted on political newsgroups were civil, and further suggested that because the absence of face-to-face communication fostered more heated discussion, cyberspace might actually promote Lyotard's vision of democratic emancipation through disagreement and anarchy (Lyotard, 1984). Thus, this study supported the internet's potential to revive the public sphere, provided that greater diversity and volume of discussion is present.},

  abstract        = {Organelles, proteins, and mRNA are transported bidirectionally along microtubules by plus-end directed kinesin and minus-end directed dynein motors. Microtubules are decorated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that organize the cytoskeleton, regulate microtubule dynamics and modulate the interaction between motor proteins and microtubules to direct intracellular transport. Tau is a neuronal MAP that stabilizes axonal microtubules and crosslinks them into bundles. Dysregulation of tau leads to a range of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau reduces the processivity of kinesin and dynein by acting as an obstacle on the microtubule. Single-molecule assays indicate that kinesin-1 is more strongly inhibited than kinesin-2 or dynein, suggesting tau might act to spatially modulate the activity of specific motors. To investigate the role of tau in regulating bidirectional transport, we isolated phagosomes driven by kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein and reconstituted their motility along microtubules. We find that tau biases bidirectional motility towards the microtubule minus-end in a dose-dependent manner. Optical trapping measurements show that tau increases the magnitude and frequency of forces exerted by dynein through inhibiting opposing kinesin motors. Mathematical modeling indicates that tau controls the directional bias of intracellular cargoes through differentially tuning the processivity of kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tau modulates motility in a motor-specific manner to direct intracellular transport, and suggests that dysregulation of tau might contribute to neurodegeneration by disrupting the balance of plus- and minus-end directed transport.},

@article{Janetos2009,
  abstract        = {Biological research is in the midst of a revolutionary change due to the inte- gration of powerful technologies along with new concepts and methods derived from inclusion of physical sciences, mathematics, computational sciences, and engineering. As never before, advances in biological sciences hold tremendous promise for surmounting many of the major challenges confronting the United States and the world. Historically, major advances in science have provided solutions to economic and social challenges. At the same time, those challenges have inspired science to focus its attention on critical needs. Scientific efforts based on meeting societal needs have laid the foundation for countless new products, industries, even entire economic sectors that were unimagined when the work began. The lessons of history led the Committee on a New Biology for the 21st Century to recommend that a New Biology Initiative be put in place and charged with finding solutions to major societal needs: sustainable food pro- duction, protection of the environment, renewable energy, and improvement in human health. These challenges represent both the mechanism for accelerating the emergence of a New Biology and its first fruits. Responding to its Statement of Task, the committee found the answer to the question How can a funda- mental understanding of living systems reduce uncertainty about the future of life on earth, improve human health and welfare, and lead to the wise steward- ship of our planet? in calling for a national initiative to apply the potential of the New Biology to addressing these societal challenges. As the report explains, the essence of the New Biology is integration re-integration of the many subdisciplines of biology, and the integration into biology of physicists, chemists, computer scientists, engineers, and mathemati- cians to create a research community with the capacity to tackle a broad range of scientific and societal problems. The committee chose biological approaches to solving problems in the areas of food, environment, energy and health as the most inspiring goals to drive the development of the New Biology. But these are not the only problems that we both hope and expect a thriving New Biology to be able to address; fundamental questions in all areas of biology, from under- standing the brain to carbon cycling in the ocean, will all be more tractable as the New Biology grows into a flourishing reality. Given the fundamental unity of biology, it is our hope and our expectation that the New Biology will contribute to advances across the life sciences. Throughout the report, New Biology is capitalized to emphasize that it is intended to be an additional and complementary effort to traditional life sciences research, not a replacement. Peer-reviewed, independent investigator-initiated research is the foundation on which the New Biology rests and on which it will continue to rely. Many exciting and important areas of biological research are not consid- ered in this report. Americas research capability in life sciences leads the world. This committee strongly endorses current research endeavors, both in the public and private sector. Within biology, the excellent work underway must be continued. But for this study, the intent was not to comprehensively review all life sciences research. Instead the committee focused on those opportunities that cannot be addressed by any one subdiscipline or agencyopportunities that require integration across biology and with other sciences and engineer- ing, and that are difficult to capitalize on within traditional institutional and funding structures. It is not merely the sciences that need to be integrated. The New Biology will draw on the research and development capabilities of universities, govern- ment, and industry. Individual federal agencies will continue to lead important, independent efforts. For the New Biology to flourish, however, interagency co-leadership of projects will be needed to a far greater extent than is the case today. This approach is not simply a matter of funding. The combined capabili- ties and expertise of numerous organizations are required to address societys greatest challenges. This study represents the collective efforts of the committee during meet- ings, workshops, a December 2008 Biology Summit, and many teleconferences. We would like to thank the Summit and workshop participants for their valu- able input. We also thank the committee members who volunteered countless hours and the Board of Life Sciences staff for their efforts and dedication to the study. Americas investment in basic research in the life sciences has paid rich dividends. A commitment to the New Biology will extend this proud record. In the words of President Obama when he addressed the 2009 annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences: As you know, scientific discovery takes far more that the occasional flash of brilliance as important as that can be. Usually, it takes time and hard work and patience; it takes training; it requires the support of a nation. But it holds promise like no other area of human endeavor. The well-being, security, and prosperity of our nation are the prize. We fully endorse the recommendations here presented.},

  abstract        = {The scale of carbon emissions associated with industrial activity and land clearing is leading to a rise in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG) at a rate unprecedented in the Cainozoic record, excepting events triggered by global volcanic eruptions, large asteroid impacts and methane release. Such an evidence is leading to attempts at classification of a new geological era - the Anthropocene. The era has been defined in terms of the onset of the modern industrial age and its acceleration since about 1950. On one hand, it could be from the onset of Neolithic agriculture and gradual rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) since ∼6000 years ago and methane since ∼4000 years ago. On the other hand, it may be an amalgamation of factors in an era referred to as the Palaeoanthropocene. This paper suggests the defining point leading to the Anthropocene and subsequently the 6th mass extinction of species hinges on the mastery of fire and thereby the magnification of energy output and entropy in nature over which, in the long term, the species has no control. The discoveries of ignition of fire and its transfer have rendered Homo a unique genus from the minimum age of {\textgreater}1.8 million years (Ma) ago, regarded as a turning point in biological evolution and termed here Early Anthropocene. The onset of the Neolithic, allowed by stabilization of the Holocene climate, is referred to as the Middle Anthropocene, while the onset of the industrial age since about 1750 AD is referred to as the Late Anthropocene. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Scale-free dynamics, with a power spectrum following P ∞ f -$\beta$, are an intrinsic feature of many complex processes in nature. In neural systems, scale-free activity is often neglected in electrophysiological research. Here, we investigate scale-free dynamics in human brain and show that it contains extensive nested frequencies, with the phase of lower frequencies modulating the amplitude of higher frequencies in an upward progression across the frequency spectrum. The functional significance of scale-free brain activity is indicated by task performance modulation and regional variation, with $\beta$ being larger in default network and visual cortex and smaller in hippocampus and cerebellum. The precise patterns of nested frequencies in the brain differ from other scale-free dynamics in nature, such as earth seismic waves and stock market fluctuations, suggesting system-specific generative mechanisms. Our findings reveal robust temporal structures and behavioral significance of scale-free brain activity and should motivate future study on its physiological mechanisms and cognitive implications. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative Computer-Supported Argument Visualization (CCSAV) is a technical methodology that offers support for online collective deliberation over complex dilemmas. As compared with more traditional conversational technologies, like wikis and forums, CCSAV is designed to promote more critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning, by using representations that highlight conceptual relationships between contributions, and through computational analytics that assess the structural integrity of the network. However, to date, CCSAV tools have achieved adoption primarily in small-scale educational contexts, and only to a limited degree in real world applications. We hypothesise that by reifying conversations as logical maps to address the shortcomings of chronological streams, CCSAV tools underestimate the importance of participation and interaction in enhancing collaborative knowledge-building. We argue, therefore, that CCSAV platforms should be socially augmented in order to improve their mediation capability. Drawing on Clark and Brennan influential Common Ground theory, we designed a Debate Dashboard, which augmented a CCSAV tool with a set of widgets that deliver meta-information about participants and the interaction process. An empirical study simulating a moderately sized collective deliberation scenario provides evidence that this experimental version outperformed the control version on a range of indicators, including usability, mutual understanding, quality of perceived collaboration, and accuracy of individual decisions. No evidence was found that the addition of the Debate Dashboard impeded the quality of the argumentation or the richness of content. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Thermodynamic studies show that tau interacts with microtubules in the low- to mid-nanomolar range, implying moderate binding affinity. At the same time, it is well established that microtubule-bound tau does not undergo exchange with the bulk medium readily, suggesting that the tau-microtubule interaction is essentially irreversible. Given this dilemma, we investigated the mechanism of interaction between tau and microtubules in kinetic detail. Stopped-flow kinetic analysis reveals moderate binding affinity between tau and preassembled microtubules and rapid dissociation/association kinetics. In contrast, when microtubules are generated by copolymerization of tubulin and tau, a distinct population of microtubule-bound tau is observed, the binding of which seems irreversible. We propose that reversible binding occurs between tau and the surface of preassembled microtubules, whereas irreversible binding results when tau is coassembled with tubulin into a tau-microtubule copolymer. Because the latter is expected to be physiologically relevant, its characterization is of central importance.},

Psychologists typically focus on underlying cognitive mechanisms at the expense of ecological validity, while behavioural ecologists generally examine adaptive function but ignore cognition. However, neophobia is an ecologically relevant fear behaviour that arises through a cognitive assessment of novel stimuli. Both fields have accrued conflicting results using various testing protocols, making it unclear what neophobia tests measure and what correlations between neophobia and other traits mean. Developing cognitively and ecologically informed tests allows neophobia to be empirically evaluated where appropriate and controlled for where it interferes with other behavioural measures. We offer guidelines for designing tests and stress the need for interdisciplinary dialogue to better explore neophobia's proximate causes and ecological consequences.},

  abstract        = {Microtubules (MTs) are polymers assembled from $\alpha$$\beta$-tubulin heterodimers that display the hallmark behavior of dynamic instability. MT dynamics are driven by GTP hydrolysis within the MT lattice, and are highly regulated by a number of MT-associated proteins (MAPs). How MAPs affect MTs is still not fully understood, partly due to a lack of high-resolution structural data on undecorated MTs, which need to serve as a baseline for further comparisons. Here we report three structures of MTs in different nucleotide states (GMPCPP, GDP, and GTP$\gamma$S) at near-atomic resolution and in the absence of any binding proteins. These structures allowed us to differentiate the effects of nucleotide state versus MAP binding on MT structure. Kinesin binding has a small effect on the extended, GMPCPP-bound lattice, but hardly affects the compacted GDP-MT lattice, while binding of end-binding (EB) proteins can induce lattice compaction (together with lattice twist) in MTs that were initially in an extended and more stable state. We propose a MT lattice-centric model in which the MT lattice serves as a platform that integrates internal tubulin signals, such as nucleotide state, with outside signals, such as binding of MAPs or mechanical forces, resulting in global lattice rearrangements that in turn affect the affinity of other MT partners and result in the exquisite regulation of MT dynamics.},

  abstract        = {Neurons, like all cells, face the problem that tubulin forms microtubules with too many or too few protofilaments (pfs). Cells overcome this heterogeneity with the $\gamma$-tubulin ring complex, which provides a nucleation template for 13-pf microtubules. Doublecortin (DCX), a protein that stabilizes microtubules in developing neurons, also nucleates 13-pf microtubules in vitro. Using fluorescence microscopy assays, we show that the binding of DCX to microtubules is optimized for the lateral curvature of the 13-pf lattice. This sensitivity depends on a cooperative interaction wherein DCX molecules decrease the dissociation rate of their neighbors. Mutations in DCX found in patients with subcortical band heterotopia weaken these cooperative interactions. Using assays with dynamic microtubules, we discovered that DCX binds to polymerization intermediates at growing microtubule ends. These results support a mechanism for stabilizing 13-pf microtubules that allows DCX to template new 13-pf microtubules through associations with the sides of the microtubule lattice. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract        = {Background: Microtubule ends have distinct biochemical and structural features from those of the lattice. Several proteins that control microtubule behavior can distinguish the end of a microtubule from the lattice. The end-binding protein EB1, for example, recognizes the nucleotide state of microtubule ends, which are enriched in GTP-tubulin. EB1 shares its binding site with Doublecortin (DCX), a protein expressed in developing neurons. We showed recently that DCX binds with highest affinity to microtubule ends.
                     Results: Here we show that DCX recognizes microtubule ends by a novel mechanism based on lattice curvature. Using single- molecule microscopy, we show that DCX "comets" do not elongate at faster microtubule growth rates and DCX does not recognize two out of three GTP analogs. We demonstrate that DCX binds with higher affinity to curved microtubule lattices than to straight ones. We find that curvature recognition is a property of single DCX molecules. Straightening of protofilaments (pfs) at microtubule ends with paclitaxel significantly attenuates end-recognition by DCX, but not EB1. Mutations in DCX found in patients with double cortex syndrome disrupted curvature recognition.
                     Conclusions: We propose a model in which DCX recognizes microtubule ends through specific interactions with their structure. We conclude that microtubule ends have two distinct features that proteins can recognize independently, namely a structural feature related to curvature and nucleotide state.},

  abstract        = {In highly polarized and elongated cells such as neurons, Tau protein must enter and move down the axon to fulfill its biological task of stabilizing axonal microtubules. Therefore, cellular systems for distributing Tau molecules are needed. This review discusses different mechanisms that have been proposed to contribute to the dispersion of Tau molecules in neurons. They include (1) directed transport along microtubules as cargo of tubulin complexes and/or motor proteins, (2) diffusion, either through the cytosolic space or along microtubules, and (3) mRNA-based mechanisms such as transport of Tau mRNA into axons and local translation. Diffusion along the microtubule lattice or through the cytosol appear to be the major mechanisms for axonal distribution of Tau protein in the short-to-intermediate range over distances of up to a millimetre. The high diffusion coefficients ensure that Tau can distribute evenly throughout the axonal volume as well as along microtubules. Motor protein-dependent transport of Tau dominates over longer distances and time scales. At low near-physiological levels, Tau is co-transported along with short microtubules from cell bodies into axons by cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin family members at rates of slow axonal transport.},

  abstract        = {It has been demonstrated that Tau exists on the microtubule lattice in both diffusing and static populations, but how this may relate to Tau function is currently unclear. Tau isoforms are developmentally regulated and have been shown to have disparate effects on microtubule polymerization, the ability to bind microtubules, and the ability to inhibit kinesin. It has also been shown that Tau is sensitive to microtubule stabilizing agents and the ability to affect the persistence length of microtubules and to inhibit kinesin can be altered by stabilizing microtubules with various nucleotide analogs. Given these observations, it is likely the behavior of Tau is dictated by both the isoform of Tau and by structural changes in the microtubule lattice. In the present study, we use single molecule imaging to examine the behavior of the three-repeat short (3RS) isoform and the four-repeat long (4RL) isoform on different microtubule tracks stabilized with either paclitaxel or guanylyl-($\alpha$,$\beta$)-methylene-diphosphate (GMPCPP). On paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules, we find 3RS-Tau favors the static conformation and forms complexes consisting of 2-3 molecules, while 4RL-Tau predominantly exists as a single molecule equally distributed between the static and diffusing populations. However, on GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules both isoforms favor the diffusing conformation and do not form static complexes composed of more than one Tau molecule. We find both isoforms of Tau interconvert between static and diffusing populations on the microtubule surface, and the equilibrium between these two states depends on both the isoform of Tau and the structure of the underlying microtubule lattice.},

  abstract        = {The ability of Tau to act as a potent inhibitor of kinesin's processive run length in vitro suggests that it may actively participate in the regulation of axonal transport in vivo. However, it remains unclear how kinesin-based transport could then proceed effectively in neurons, where Tau is expressed at high levels. One potential explanation is that Tau, a conformationally dynamic protein, has multiple modes of interaction with the microtubule, not all of which inhibit kinesin's processive run length. Previous studies support the hypothesis that Tau has at least two modes of interaction with microtubules, but the mechanisms by which Tau adopts these different conformations and their functional consequences have not been investigated previously. In the present study, we have used single molecule imaging techniques to demonstrate that Tau inhibits kinesin's processive run length in an isoform-dependent manner on GDP-microtubules stabilized with either paclitaxel or glycerol/DMSO but not guanosine-5'-(($\alpha$,$\beta$)-methyleno)triphosphate (GMPCPP)-stabilized microtubules. Furthermore, the order of Tau addition to microtubules before or after polymerization has no effect on the ability of Tau to modulate kinesin motility regardless of the stabilizing agent used. Finally, the processive run length of kinesin is reduced on GMPCPP-microtubules relative to GDP-microtubules, and kinesin's velocity is enhanced in the presence of 4-repeat long Tau but not the 3-repeat short isoform. These results shed new light on the potential role of Tau in the regulation of axonal transport, which is more complex than previously recognized.},

To investigate the interaction of tau with MTs in living cells, we expressed GFP-tau fusion protein in cultured Xenopus embryo neurons and performed time-lapse imaging of tau-labeled MTs. Tau uniformly labeled individual MTs regardless of their assembly/disassembly status and location along the axon. Photobleaching experiments indicated that interaction of tau with MTs is very dynamic, with a half-time of fluorescence recovery of the order of 3 seconds. Treatment of cells with taxol, a drug that suppresses MT dynamics, rapidly induced detachment of tau from MTs. Although binding of tau to straight MTs was uniform, there was a heightened concentration of tau at the sites of high MT curvature. Our results suggest that dynamic interaction of tau with MTs may modify local mechanical properties of individual MTs and play a crucial role in the remodeling of the MT cytoskeleton during neuronal plasticity.},

An important regulator of this system, the microtubule-associated protein Tau, has been shown to participate in signaling cascades, modulate microtubule dynamics, and preferentially inhibit kinesin-1 motility. However, the cellular means of regulating Tau's inhibition of kinesin-1 motility remains unknown. Tau is subject to various posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, but whether phosphorylation regulates Tau on the microtubule surface has not been addressed. It has been shown that tyrosine 18 phosphorylated Tau regulates inhibition of axonal transport in the disease state. Tyrosine 18 is both a disease- and nondisease-state modification and is therefore an attractive starting point for understanding control of Tau's inhibition of kinesin-1 motility. We show that pseudophosphorylation of tyrosine 18 reduces 3RS-Tau's inhibition of kinesin-1 motility. In addition, we show that introduction of negative charge at tyrosine 18 shifts Tau's previously described static-dynamic state binding equilibrium toward the dynamic state. We also present the first evidence of Tau's static-dynamic state equilibrium under physiological conditions.},

Tau aggregation into insoluble fibrils is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, yet the physiological state of tau molecules within cells remains unclear. Using single molecule imaging, we directly observe that the microtubule lattice regulates reversible tau self-association, leading to dynamic condensation of tau molecules on the microtubule surface. Tau condensates form selectively permissible barriers, spatially regulating the activity of MT severing enzymes and the movement of molecular motors through their boundaries. We propose that reversible self-association of tau molecules, controlled by the microtubule, is an important mechanism of tau's biological functions, and that oligomerization of tau is a common property shared between the physiological and disease forms of the molecule.},

  abstract        = {Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein with an important role in maintaining the dynamic instability of neuronal microtubules. Despite intensive study, a detailed understanding of the func-tional mechanism of tau is lacking. Here, we address this deficiency by using intramolecular single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster Reso-nance Energy Transfer (smFRET) to characterize the conforma-tional ensemble of tau bound to soluble tubulin heterodimers. Tau adopts an open conformation on binding tubulin, in which the long-range contacts between both termini and the microtu-bule binding region that characterize its compact solution struc-ture are diminished. Moreover, the individual repeats within the microtubule binding region that directly interface with tubulin expand to accommodate tubulin binding, despite a lack of exten-sion in the overall dimensions of this region. These results sug-gest that the disordered nature of tau provides the significant flexibility required to allow for local changes in conformation while preserving global features. The tubulin-associated confor-mational ensemble is distinct from its aggregation-prone one, high-lighting differences between functional and dysfunctional states of tau. Using constraints derived from our measurements, we con-struct a model of tubulin-bound tau, which draws attention to the importance of the role of tau's conformational plasticity in function. single-molecule FRET | intrinsically disordered proteins | microtubule-associated protein | tauopathies | Alzheimer's disease M icrotubules play an important role in a host of critical cellular processes, including positioning of organelles, maintaining cell shape, axonal transport, and cell division (1–3). Their constit-uent subunits, $\alpha$/$\beta$-tubulin heterodimers, polymerize head to tail to form linear protofilaments that subsequently associate laterally into microtubules. Microtubules are dynamic structures with biological functions that are dependent on their ability to grow and shrink in a temporally and spatially controlled manner in response to cellular signals. Critical to microtubule function is that they undergo non-equilibrium phases of elongation and depolymerization, termed dynamic instability (4). Given the importance of dynamic instability to microtubule function, it is highly regulated by a family of nucleotide-independent microtubule-associated proteins (5). Tau is a microtubule-associated protein first characterized as a promoter of microtubule assembly both in vitro (6) and in vivo (7). Numerous studies have helped provide details on its role in modulating microtubule growth dynamics (8–11). Tau is found primarily in the axons of neurons (12, 13). It is thought that tau may have an important role in regulating axonal transport (14, 15), and it has been reported to inhibit the activity of several micro-tubule motor proteins (16–18). Aggregation of tau is linked to a number of neurodegenerative disorders termed tauopathies, among them Alzheimer's disease (reviewed in ref. 19). Addi-tionally, the loss of native, functional interactions between tau and microtubules and subsequent destabilization of microtu-bules are thought to contribute to pathology (20, 21). Mutations linked to disease have been observed to enhance binding of tau to soluble tubulin (22) as well as disrupt interactions with microtubules (23, 24), suggesting possible mechanisms for the loss of microtubule stability. Tau consists of a microtubule binding region (MTBR) composed of imperfect repeats R1–R4 (25), a flanking basic proline-rich re-gion (P1 and P2) that enhances microtubule binding and assembly (9), and an N-terminal projection domain with putative roles in microtubule spacing (26), membrane anchoring (27), and tau di-merization (28) (Fig. 1). Alternative splicing results in the expres-sion of six isoforms of tau in the adult human brain, with up to two N-terminal inserts and three or four repeats in the MTBR. Each repeat consists of an interrepeat or linker region and the conserved sequence. Contrasting models of tau in complex with microtubules suggest binding on the outer surface either along or across proto-filaments (29, 30) or inside the microtubule lumen (31). Both the negatively charged C-terminal tails of tubulin (32) and the interface between $\alpha$/$\beta$-subunits (33) have been identified as important for tau binding. Although significant work has focused on this interaction, relatively little is known about the structural features of tau when associated with tubulin or microtubules. This lack of detail is, in part, because tau is intrinsically disordered in solution (34, 35) and appears to remain largely disordered even on binding, making its structural characterization challenging. Single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is a powerful approach for probing conformations of large, dynamic proteins, including tau (22, 36). In addition to providing insight into structural features of such proteins, the picomolar concentrations of},

We used Site Directed Spin Labeling combined with EPR spectroscopy to monitor Tau upon binding to either Taxol-stabilized MTs or to $\alpha$$\beta$-tubulin when Tau is directly used as an inducer of MTs formation. Using maleimide-functionalized labels grafted on the two natural cysteine residues of Tau, we found in both cases that Tau remains highly flexible in these regions confirming the fuzziness of Tau:MTs complexes. More interestingly, using labels linked by a disulfide bridge, we evidenced for the first time thiol disulfide exchanges between $\alpha$$\beta$-tubulin or MTs and Tau. Additionally, Tau fragments having the two natural cysteines or variants containing only one of them were used to determine the role of each cysteine individually. The difference observed in the label release kinetics between preformed MTs or Tau-induced MTs, associated to a comparison of structural data, led us to propose two putative binding sites of Tau on $\alpha$$\beta$-tubulin.},

  abstract        = {Down syndrome (DS) is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. The phenotype of DS is thought to result from overexpression of a gene or genes located on the triplicated chromosome or chromosome region. Several reports have shown that the neuropathology of DS comprises developmental abnormalities and Alzheimer-like lesions such as senile plaques. A key component of senile plaques is amyloid beta-peptide which is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential action of beta-secretases (BACE1 and BACE2) and gamma-secretase. While BACE1 maps to chromosome 11, APP and BACE2 are located on chromosome 21. To challenge the gene dosage effect and gain insight into the expressional relation between beta-secretases and APP in DS brain, we evaluated protein expression levels of BACE1, BACE2 and APP in fetal and adult DS brain compared to controls. In fetal brain, protein expression levels of BACE2 and APP were comparable between DS and controls. BACE1 was increased, but did not reach statistical significance. In adult brain, BACE1 and BACE2 were comparable between DS and controls, but APP was significantly increased. We conclude that APP overexpression seems to be absent during the development of DS brain up to 18-19 weeks of gestational age. However, its overexpression in adult DS brain could lead to disturbance of normal function of APP contributing to neurodegeneration. Comparable expression of BACE1 and BACE2 speaks against the hypothesis that increased beta-secretase results in (or even underlies) increased production of amyloidogenic A beta fragments. Furthermore, current data indicate that the DS phenotype cannot be fully explained by simple gene dosage effect.},

  abstract        = {Tau protein modulates microtubule dynamics and forms insoluble aggregates in Alzheimer's disease. Because there is a discrepancy between reported affinities of Tau to microtubules, we determined the interaction over a wide concentration range using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that the interaction is biphasic and not monophasic as assumed earlier. The first binding phase is typical for identical and noninteracting binding sites, with dissociation constants around 0.1 micrometer and stoichiometries around 0.2 Tau/tubulin dimer. Surprisingly, the second phase is nonsaturable and shows a nearly linear increase in bound Tau versus free Tau for free Tau concentrations higher than 2 micrometer. The slope is proportional to the microtubule concentration. From this we define an overloading parameter with values around 50 micrometer. The influence of Tau isoform, phosphorylation, and dimerization on both phases was investigated. Remarkably the overloading of Tau on microtubules leads to a thioflavin S fluorescence increase reminiscent of that seen with Tau aggregated into Alzheimer paired helical filaments. Because polyanions stimulate Tau aggregation and because the C-terminal domain of tubulin is polyanionic, we suggest that an early conformational change in Tau leading to paired helical filament aggregation occurs right on the microtubule surface.},

The molecular mechanism by which chromosomes induce local microtubule nucleation in the absence of centrosomes is unknown, but it can be studied by adding chromatin beads to Xenopus egg extracts. The beads nucleate microtubules that eventually reorganize into a bipolar spindle. RCC1, the guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor for the GTPase protein Ran, is a component of chromatin. Using the chromatin bead assay, we show here that the activity of chromosome-associated RCC1 protein is required for spindle formation. Ran itself, when in the GTP-bound state (Ran-GTP), induces microtubule nucleation and spindle-like structures in M-phase extract. We propose that RCC1 generates a high local concentration of Ran-GTP around chromatin which in turn induces the local nucleation of microtubules.},

  abstract        = {PreScission Protease is a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and human rhinovirus (HRV) type 14 3C protease (1). The protease specifically recognizes a subset of sequences which include the core amino acid sequence Leu-Phe-Gln/Gly-Pro cleaving between the Gln and Gly residues (2). Substrate recognition and cleavage are likely to be dependent not only upon primary structural signals, but also upon the secondary and tertiary structures of the fusion protein aswell. Since the protease is fused to GST, it is easily removed from cleavage reactions using Glutathione Sepharose™4B. Fusion proteins produced from pGEX-6P-1 (27-4597-01), pGEX-6P-2 (27-4598-01) and pGEX-6P-3 (27-4599-01) will be cleaved by PreScission Protease between the GST moiety and the cloned fusion partner. The molecular weight of PreScission Protease is approximately 46 kDa. During cleavage reactions, it is recommended that samples be removed at various time points and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to estimate the yield, purity and extent of digestion. The amount of PreScission Protease, temperature and length of incubation required for complete digestion of a given GST fusion protein may vary depending on the fusion partner. Optimal conditions for each fusion should be determined in pilot experiments. Purification},

A large number of these proteins are intrinsically disordered, gaining some secondary structure when they interact with their binding partners. These partners include the component ions of the mineral being deposited, the crystals themselves, the template on which the initial crystals form, and other intrinsically disordered proteins and peptides. This review speculates why intrinsically disordered proteins are so important for biomineralization, providing illustrations from the SIBLING (small integrin binding N-glycosylated) proteins and their peptides. It is concluded that the flexible structure, and the ability of the intrinsically disordered proteins to bind to a multitude of surfaces is crucial, but details on the precise-interactions, energetics and kinetics of binding remain to be determined.},

In yeast, the EB1 homologue (BIM1) has been shown to modulate microtubule dynamics and link microtubules to the cortex, but the functions of metazoan EB1 proteins remain unknown. Using a novel preparation of the Drosophila S2 cell line that promotes cell attachment and spreading, we visualized dynamics of single microtubules in real time and found that depletion of EB1 by RNA-mediated inhibition (RNAi) in interphase cells causes a dramatic increase in nondynamic microtubules (neither growing nor shrinking), but does not alter overall microtubule organization. In contrast, several defects in microtubule organization are observed in RNAi-treated mitotic cells, including a drastic reduction in astral microtubules, malformed mitotic spindles, defocused spindle poles, and mispositioning of spindles away from the cell center. Similar phenotypes were observed in mitotic spindles of Drosophila embryos that were microinjected with anti-EB1 antibodies. In addition, live cell imaging of mitosis in Drosophila embryos reveals defective spindle elongation and chromosomal segregation during anaphase after antibody injection. Our results reveal crucial roles for EB1 in mitosis, which we postulate involves its ability to promote the growth and interactions of microtubules within the central spindle and at the cell cortex.},

To gain insight into the meaning of this prominent variability, we studied the way in which its magnitude depends on the growth rate of experimentally observed and computer-simulated microtubules. The dynamic properties of plus-ended microtubules nucleated by pieces of Chlamydomonas flagellar axonemes were observed in real time by video-enhanced differential interference contrast light microscopy at differing tubulin concentrations. By means of a Monte Carlo algorithm, populations of microtubules were simulated that had similar growth and dynamic properties to the experimentally observed microtubules. By comparison of the experimentally observed and computer-simulated populations of microtubules, we found that 1) individual microtubules displayed an intrinsic variability that did not change as the rate of growth for a population increased, and 2) the variability was approximately fivefold greater than predicted by a simple model of subunit addition and loss. The model used to simulate microtubule growth has no provision for incorporation of lattice defects of any type, nor sophisticated geometry of the growing end. Thus, these as well as uncontrolled experimental variables were eliminated as causes for the prominent variability.},

  abstract        = {Microtubules polymerize from GTP-liganded tubulin dimers, but are essentially made of GDP-liganded tubulin. We investigate the tug-of-war resulting from the fact that GDP-liganded tubulin favors a curved configuration, but is forced to remain in a straight one when part of a microtubule. We point out that near the end of a microtubule, the proximity of the end shifts the balance in this tug-of-war, with some protofilament bending as result. This somewhat relaxes the microtubule lattice near its end, resulting in a structural cap. This structural cap thus is a simple mechanical consequence of two well-established facts: protofilaments made of GDP-liganded tubulin have intrinsic curvature, and microtubules are elastic, made from material that can yield to forces, in casu its own intrinsic forces. We explore possible properties of this structural cap, and demonstrate 1) how it allows both polymerization from GTP-liganded tubulin and rapid depolymerization in its absence; 2) how rescue can occur; 3) how a third, meta-stable intermediate state is possible and can explain some experimental results; and 4) how the tapered tips observed at polymerizing microtubule ends are stabilized during growth, though unable to accommodate a lateral cap. This scenario thus supports the widely accepted GTP-cap model by suggesting a stabilizing mechanism that explains the many aspects of dynamic instability.},

  abstract        = {Microtubule plus ends dynamically attach to kinetochores on mitotic chromosomes. We directly imaged this dynamic interface using high resolution fluorescent speckle microscopy and direct labeling of kinetochores in Xenopus extract spindles. During metaphase, kinetochores were stationary and under tension while plus end polymerization and poleward microtubule flux (flux) occurred at velocities varying from 1.5-2.5 micro m/min. Because kinetochore microtubules polymerize at metaphase kinetochores, the primary source of kinetochore tension must be the spindle forces that produce flux and not a kinetochore-based mechanism. We infer that the kinetochore resists translocation of kinetochore microtubules through their attachment sites, and that the polymerization state of the kinetochore acts a "slip-clutch" mechanism that prevents detachment at high tension. At anaphase onset, kinetochores switched to depolymerization of microtubule plus ends, resulting in chromosome-to-pole rates transiently greater than flux. Kinetochores switched from persistent depolymerization to persistent polymerization and back again during anaphase, bistability exhibited by kinetochores in vertebrate tissue cells. These results provide the most complete description of spindle microtubule poleward flux to date, with important implications for the microtubule-kinetochore interface and for how flux regulates kinetochore function.},

Once this model is developed, the method for comparing simulation results to experimental data must be carefully considered. The ultimate utility of any computational model relies on its predictive power and the ability to assist in designing new experiments. We describe how "deconstructing" the model through the use of quantitative animations contributes to a better qualitative understanding of model behavior.

The notch filter is implemented as a constrained infinite impulse response filter with the constraint enforced by a single parameter termed the debiasing parameter. The resulting notch filter requires few parameters, facilitates the formation of the desired band rejection filter response, and also leads to various useful implementations (cascade, parallel). For the adaptation of the filter coefficients, the stochastic Gauss-Newton algorithm is used. The convergence of this updating procedure is established by studying the associated differential equation. Also, it is shown that the structure present in the problem enables truncation of the gradient, thereby reducing the complexity of adapting the filter coefficients. Simulation results are presented to substantiate the analysis, and to demonstrate the potential of the notch filtering technique.},

  abstract        = {Proper microtubule organization is essential for cellular processes such as organelle positioning during interphase and spindle formation during mitosis. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe presents a good model for understanding microtubule organization. We identify fission yeast ase1p, a member of the conserved ASE1/PRC1/MAP65 family of microtubule bundling proteins, which functions in organizing the spindle midzone during mitosis. Using fluorescence live cell imaging, we show that ase1p localizes to sites of microtubule overlaps associated with microtubule organizing centers at both interphase and mitosis. ase1? mutants fail to form overlapping antiparallel microtubule bundles, leading to interphase nuclear positioning defects, and premature mitotic spindle collapse. FRAP analysis revealed that interphase ase1p at overlapping microtubule minus ends is highly dynamic. In contrast, mitotic ase1p at microtubule plus ends at the spindle midzone is more stable. We propose that ase1p functions to organize microtubules into overlapping antiparallel bundles both in interphase and mitosis and that ase1p may be differentially regulated through the cell cycle.},

  abstract        = {Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that are dynamically assembled from $\alpha$/$\beta$-tubulin heterodimers. The primary sequence and structure of the tubulin proteins and, consequently, the properties and architecture of microtubules are highly conserved in eukaryotes. Despite this conservation, tubulin is subject to heterogeneity that is generated in two ways: by the expression of different tubulin isotypes and by posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Identifying the mechanisms that generate and control tubulin heterogeneity and how this heterogeneity affects microtubule function are long-standing goals in the field. Recent work on tubulin PTMs has shed light on how these modifications could contribute to a "tubulin code" that coordinates the complex functions of microtubules in cells.},

Our observations reveal a transition in the length dynamics of microtubules from bounded to unbounded growth. This transition is also evident in the length dynamics of individual site-nucleated microtubules. The transition to spon- taneous microtubule assembly completes the phase diagram. We measure the temperature and concen- tration dependence of the latent time for spontaneous nucleation of microtubules in the bulk.},

  abstract        = {Short regions of overlap between ends of antiparallel microtubules are central elements within bipolar microtubule arrays. Although their formation requires motors, recent in vitro studies demonstrated that stable overlaps cannot be generated by molecular motors alone. Motors either slide microtubules along each other until complete separation or, in the presence of opposing motors, generate oscillatory movements. Here, we show that Ase1, a member of the conserved MAP65/PRC1 family of microtubule-bundling proteins, enables the formation of stable antiparallel overlaps through adaptive braking of Kinesin-14-driven microtubule-microtubule sliding. As overlapping microtubules start to slide apart, Ase1 molecules become compacted in the shrinking overlap and the sliding velocity gradually decreases in a dose-dependent manner. Compaction is driven by moving microtubule ends that act as barriers to Ase1 diffusion. Quantitative modelling showed that the molecular off-rate of Ase1 is sufficiently low to enable persistent overlap stabilization over tens of minutes. The finding of adaptive braking demonstrates that sliding can be slowed down locally to stabilize overlaps at the centre of bipolar arrays, whereas sliding proceeds elsewhere to enable network self-organization.},

  abstract        = {Spatial regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics contributes to cell polarity and cell division. MT rescue, in which a MT stops shrinking and reinitiates growth, is the least understood aspect of MT dynamics. Cytoplasmic Linker Associated Proteins (CLASPs) are a conserved class of MT-associated proteins that contribute to MT stabilization and rescue in vivo. We show here that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe CLASP, Cls1p, is a homodimer that binds an $\alpha$$\beta$-tubulin heterodimer through conserved TOG-like domains. In vitro, CLASP increases MT rescue frequency, decreases MT catastrophe frequency, and moderately decreases MT disassembly rate. CLASP binds stably to the MT lattice, recruits tubulin, and locally promotes rescues. Mutations in the CLASP TOG domains demonstrate that tubulin binding is critical for its rescue activity. We propose a mechanism for rescue in which CLASP-tubulin dimer complexes bind along the MT lattice and reverse MT depolymerization with their bound tubulin dimer. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},
