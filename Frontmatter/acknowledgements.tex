    I declare that I wrote this thesis independently and cited all the information sources and literature used. I also declare that I indicated the contributions of co-authors appropriately. In particular, certain parts of data acquisition and analysis of the tau-related experiments were performed by Valerie Siahaan (a member of the Laboratory of Structural Proteins), and her contribution is always acknowledged in the caption of the figures. No substantial part of this work has been submitted for the award of any other or the same academic degree, though a share of the results presented in this thesis was also presented in the doctoral thesis by Valerie Siahaan, which was difficult to avoid given our tight collaboration during some of the time of my work in the Laboratory of Structural Proteins and us consequently sharing first-authorship in our publication "Kinetically distinct phases of tau on microtubules regulate kinesin motors and severing enzymes."
