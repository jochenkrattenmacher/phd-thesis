\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I first and foremost want to thank my two supervisors Zdenek Lansky and Marcus Braun for the opportunity to work on the projects presented in this thesis, their continued support, and not least their patience throughout my sometimes rather zigzaggy journey! I also want to thank Valerie Siahaan for the productive collaboration on the Tau story and the beautiful experimental data she produced. Similarly, I want to thank all the other co-authors of my publications for the fruitful collaboration, in particular Manuel-Lera Ramirez, Stefan Diez, Alexandre Beber, Amayra Hernandez-Vega, Lenka Grycova, and Francois Nedelec. Special thanks also to Ilia Zhernov and Jan Sabo for having been super-helpful colleagues, as well as the members of the BIOCEV imaging facility!
