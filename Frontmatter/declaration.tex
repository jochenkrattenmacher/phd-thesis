\chapter*{Declaration}
I declare that I wrote this thesis independently and cited all the information sources and literature used. I also declare that I indicated the contributions of co-authors appropriately. In particular, certain parts of data acquisition of the Tau-related experiments were performed by Valerie Siahaan (a member of the Laboratory of Structural Proteins), as described in the "Publications" section of this thesis. No substantial part of this work has been submitted for the award of any other or the same academic degree, though a small share of the results presented in this thesis was also presented in the doctoral thesis by Valerie Siahaan, which was difficult to avoid given our tight collaboration during some of the time of my work in the Laboratory of Structural Proteins and us consequently sharing first-authorship in our publication "Kinetically distinct phases of Tau on microtubules regulate kinesin motors and severing enzymes." The figure panels which have also been presented in Valerie's thesis (\cite{Siahaan}) are marked as such in the respective figure captions.\\
