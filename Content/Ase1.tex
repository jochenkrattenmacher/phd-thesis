The scale bars are 5 micron and 10 minutes. In sketches, dynamic extensions with GDP lattices are red, and stabilized GMPCPP seeds are blue. The teal bars next to kymographs indicate the presence of regions of overlap (we only counted regions where the two partaking microtubule regions are constituted by GDP-tubulin, i.e., a seed stabilized by GMPCPP did not count). The orange lines indicate a termination of the overlapping period, as evaluated for \autoref{ase1b}A. (B) Same representation as A showing events from experiments performed at 420nM Ase1. (C) Snapshots of different events than shown in A and B, illustrating microtubule bundling (at 42nM). (D) Bundling probability for situations when microtubule plus ends encountered other microtubules, in either parallel or antiparallel orientation, versus the initial angle of interaction (results pooled for all Ase1-mNeonGreen concentrations). The outer numbers denote the numbers of recorded crossings at the respective angle, while the inner numbers denote the numbers of bundling events (the sum of both numbers is the total number of observed events).

To investigate the interaction dynamics between diffusible microtubule crosslinkers and microtubules, we employed total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and interference reflection microscopy (IRM) (\autoref{sec:microscopy}) time-lapse imaging of immobilized, GMPCPP-stabilized microtubule seeds in the presence of 30 µM free tubulin and varying concentrations of Ase1 (Methods). At concentrations of 42 nM and 420 nM Ase1, we observed dynamic, Ase1-decorated microtubule extensions polymerizing from the microtubule seeds \pref{ase1a}{A,B}. When two microtubule plus ends, emanating from different seeds and polymerizing towards each other, encountered each other, the microtubules either bundled or crossed, depending on the angle of incidence. Typically, at high angles, the microtubules crossed and only interacted at the crossing point, while at small angles, either parallel or antiparallel associations could be formed \pref{ase1a}{C}. As previously reported \parencite{Janson2007}, antiparallel bundles formed even at large initial angles of incidence (up to 40°), while parallel bundles only formed at initial angles below 20° \pref{ase1a}{D}.\par

\end{wrapfigure}
Quantitative analysis revealed increased lifetimes of antiparallel overlaps compared to parallel ones\pref{ase1b}{A} Notably, at 42 nM Ase1 in solution, the Ase1 density on antiparallel overlaps was an order of magnitude higher than on parallel ones\pref{ase1b}{B} consistent with the previously reported differential affinities \parencite{Janson2007}. At 420 nM Ase1, we observed the density of Ase1 to be similar on antiparallel and parallel bundles, roughly twice the density found on isolated microtubules\pref{ase1b}{B} This possibly indicated that, at this high concentration, a similar number of Ase1 molecules was present within parallel and antiparallel overlaps. Note, however, that this value represents the total density of Ase1 at the bundle, which might differ from the density of Ase1 molecules directly engaged in MT crosslinking by being bound simultaneously to both microtubules. Despite similar decoration levels by Ase1, antiparallel overlaps were still significantly more stable than parallel ones\pref{ase1b}{A} Given the low polymerization velocity of minus ends, we very rarely observed antiparallel overlaps formed by two minus ends encountering each other, and we thus could not meaningfully quantify the associated lifetime. Generally, we chose to not analyze minus ends given that they are not dynamic \textit{in vivo} \parencite{dammer}.\par

To test whether the relative stability of antiparallel overlaps was caused by Ase1 crosslinking or the bundling itself (as was requested by a reviewer), we also conducted experiments at 10nM Ase1. At this concentration, we observed significantly less Ase1 within antiparallel bundles \pref{ase1c}{A}, and indeed, antiparallel bundles were no more stable than parallel bundles \pref{ase1c}{B}. Also, at 10nM Ase1 we observed antiparallel microtubules to no longer bundle as readily as at higher Ase1 concentrations \pref{ase1c}{C}. While we could detect an Ase1 signal at antiparallel overlaps, we did observe events where Ase1 crosslinking apparently was not strong enough to keep a MT plus end bundled to the MT along which it was growing in an antiparallel orientation \pref{ase1c}{D,E left panel}. Finally, to test whether microtubule bundling in our assays was partially a result of molecular crowding (and not Ase1), we performed an assay at 0nM Ase1. In absence of Ase1, microtubules never bundled, even when very close to each other over extended periods of time, indicating that molecular crowding did not play a role in the microtubule bundling we observed \pref{ase1c}{F}. \par

The relative stability of antiparallel overlaps at high Ase1 concentrations may at least partly owe to the fact that antiparallel overlaps grow with twice the speed of parallel overlaps (since both microtubules polymerize in opposite directions, however it should be noted that once a minus end has been surpassed the antiparallel overlaps does no longer grow as quickly on the side in question); hence, there is more opportunities for rescues to occur during depolymerization. However, our kymographs suggested that antiparallel overlaps may be additionally stabilized by an increase in rescue frequency \pref{ase1d}{A}, and we set out to quantify this issue next. \par

Indeed, as indicated by the kymographs shown in \pref{ase1d}{A}, we found rescue frequencies to be increased for antiparallelly crosslinked microtubules at the Ase1 concentrations where we had observed increased lifetimes of these overlaps \pref{ase1d}{B}. To test whether Ase1 crosslinking might have other significant effects on MT polymerization, we next quantified the other three parameters of microtubule dynamic instability. We found that catastrophe frequencies were similar across the tested conditions, with no statistically significant difference between the different populations \pref{ase1d}{C}. Polymerization velocities were similar for all microtubule types, either isolated or bundled, across all tested Ase1 concentrations as well \pref{ase1d}{D}. However, at 420nM Ase1, MTs depolymerized markedly slower than at lower Ase1 concentrations. Further, at 42nM and 420nM Ase1, antiparallel MTs displayed a marked decrease in depolymerization velocity compared to isolated and parallel MTs \pref{ase1d}{E}. Thus, we observed Ase1 to only have a measurable effect on MT depolymerization, by reducing the rate of depolymerization and increasing chances for rescue, with no effect on polymerization.\par

If one only considers our results at 42nM, one could speculate that the particularly pronounced stabilization of antiparallel microtubules was due to the increased number of Ase1 molecules on antiparallel MTs as compared to parallel and isolated MTs. However, at 420nM, the number of Ase1 molecules per MT was similar across all types of MTs, while the antiparallel MTs still were more stable, despite indistinguishable Ase1 densities on antiparallel versus parallel MT overlaps \pref{ase1d}{F,G}. Thus, Ase1 engaged in antiparallel crosslinking seems to have a stronger effect on MT depolymerization than Ase1 engaged in parallel crosslinking or Ase1 not engaged in crosslinking. This deduction is supported by the fact that the number of Ase1 molecules engaged in Ase1 crosslinking was the only factor we could identify as influencing the frequency of rescues (note, however, that the number of molecules directly participating in the crosslinking process, i.e. simultaneously bound to both crosslinked microtubules, is not measurable in this assay). Notably, we with a different set of experiments ("Set B experiments," see Methods) found the same result \autoref{ase1e}, showing the robustness of this finding: At these conditions, we observed antiparallely linked microtubules to exhibit rescues, at a density of around 0.2 molecules per nm which we at these buffer conditions had established with 1nM Ase1 \pref{ase1e}{B,C} (as a side note, the Ase1 used in these experiments had a different fluorescence label, GFP instead of mNeonGreen). At these buffer conditions, isolated microtubules did not exhibit any rescues at all, even when we increased the Ase1 concentration from 1 to 6nM such that the Ase1 density on isolated microtubules was comparable to the Ase1 density on antiparallel bundles at 1nM Ase1 \pref{ase1e}{B,C}. The depolymerization velocity similarly decreased with increasing Ase1 concentration \pref{ase1e}{D}. Altogether, these results show that Ase1 can stabilize antiparallel microtubules while only having minor stabilization effects on MTs outside of such overlaps.

Given that we had shown that Ase1 can stabilize depolymerizing microtubules, we suspected that Ase1 molecules very likely interact directly with depolymerizing MT ends. This is indeed what we found when examining the distribution of Ase1. While Ase1 did show no preference for binding to polymerizing MT ends, the kymographs which we had generated showed that Ase1 accumulated at depolymerizing MT ends, for Set A experiments \pref{ase2a}{A,B} as well as Set B experiments \pref{ase2b}{A}. We now set out to quantify this effect. Because the data for Set B experiments allowed for a more fine-grained analysis due to a higher framerate and a more pronounced accumulation effect, we in the following limited our analysis to the Set B experimental data. Given that isolated and parallel MTs behaved very similarly in our assays (though only in Set A experiments we observed a sufficiently high number of parallel overlaps for a thorough analysis), we also chose to focus on comparing isolated and antiparallel MTs.\par

Our quantitative analysis of Ase1 accumulation at depolymerizing microtubule ends confirmed the visual impression given by the kymographs - Ase1 was indeed accumulating at depolymerizing MT ends, for both isolated and antiparallel MTs \pref{ase2b}{B}. In addition, the quantitative analysis also revealed that the Ase1 accumulates were growing the quickest during the early stages of depolymerization \pref{ase2b}{B}. Intuitively, one may expect that this accumulation is related to the stabilization of microtubules during depolymerization. Indeed, Ase1 accumulation correlated with a decrease in depolymerization speed \pref{ase2b}{B-D}. While this correlation does not imply a causal relationship, it does lend support to the existence of such a relationship. An alternative explanation could be a possible hidden third factor, most notably the natural slowdown of depolymerization velocity after catastrophe which has been observed by others \parencite{Luchniak2023}. In other words, it is conceivable that depolymerizing MTs accumulate Ase1 and slow down over time, and that these two phenomena are not causally related. However, in the absence of Ase1 we had not observed any slowdown in MT depolymerization comparable to what we observed in the presence of Ase1 \pref{ase2b}{C}. \par

(B) Time series of micrographs (Ase1-GFP channel) showing an event where the accumulated Ase1 at one depolymerizing MT end (indicated by red arrows) causes the end to “drag” a MT it crosses with it, thereby bending it (yellow arrows).

The number of rescues observed in the same bin (N) was then divided by the sum of depolymerization durations (shown in min, the number in parentheses refers to the number of MTs) to estimate the rescue frequency. The correlation coefficient (weighted \parencite{Pelletier2024} by sums of depolymerization durations) is 0.67. The total length of a given error bar equals two times the square root of the number of the rescues in the corresponding bin divided by the sum of the time depolymerized in the corresponding bin.

Our findings so far suggested that we observed "herding" of Ase1 by the depolymerizing MT end, a phenomenon which has recently been reported for a synthetic MT crosslinker \parencite{Drechsler2019}. To confirm this, we needed to exclude the possibility that Ase1 specifically tracks depolymerizing MT ends by having a higher affinity for depolymerizing MT regions. We thus performed an experiment where we removed both Ase1 and tubulin from solution after first having polymerized Ase1-decorated MTs. We found Ase1 to still accumulate at the ends of depolymerizing MT \pref{ase2c}{A}, indicating that the accumulates are indeed comprised of Ase1 molecules that were already bound to the MT lattice before catastrophe had occurred. As reported for the synthetic polymer \parencite{Drechsler2019}, we also observed instances of depolymerizing MT ends which herded Ase1 molecules pulling on other MTs \pref{ase2c}{B}. This indicates that substantial forces can be transmitted via Ase1 herding.\par

What is the impact of Ase1 herding on the depolymerization of antiparallel MTs in particular? Similarly to what we found in \aref{sec:ase11}{}, we found that the impact of single Ase1 molecules on the depolymerization of antiparallel MTs is stronger than in the case of isolated microtubules: While isolated microtubules at 6nM Ase1 herded more Ase1 than antiparallel microtubules at 1nM Ase1, they did not depolymerize more slowly than antiparallel MTs \pref{ase2b}{B,C}. For antiparallel MTs, we also observed the number of herded Ase1 molecules to positively correlate with the probability of a rescue occuring \pref{ase1c}{C} (a phenomenon we could not test for isolated MTs since they did not exhibit any rescues in this dataset; furthermore, the rescue frequency of isolated MTs appears independent from Ase1 density, see \aref{ase1d}{B}). Moreover, the Ase1 density at the microtubule end, which is a measure for not only accumulated Ase1 but the total number of Ase1 molecules present at the end, also shows a positive correlation with rescue frequency \pref{ase1c}{D}.\par

Ase1 does not fall off from the MT by hopping at its plus ends (red crossed arrow on the left). (B) In Model 1, we assume that the detachment rate of the tubulin terminal subunit is $k_d^0$ when the first tubulin subunit is free of Ase1, and $k_d=(1-\Omega)k_d^0$ if Ase1 is bound at the terminal site (for Model 2, see Main Text and Methods).

Our experiments thus demonstrate that lattice-bound Ase1 molecules are herded by the depolymerizing MT ends and that the number of swept Ase1 molecules correlates with reduced depolymerization. Yet how do these effects relate to each other? We set out to tackle this question by mathematically modeling Ase1 herding, focusing on the relation between depolymerization velocity and Ase1 accumulation. We thus developed a simple mathematical model that considers a one-dimensional MT made of lattice sites corresponding to tubulin heterodimers, starting at the plus end (see Methods). The model neglects the interaction between protofilaments, and for simplicity focuses on the effect of Ase1 on the depolymerization velocity of isolated MTs. Events such as Ase1 binding, unbinding, and hopping to neighboring sites are stochastic with constant rates $k_{on},k_{off},k_h$ \pref{ase1d}{A}. These rates were determined experimentally, via velocity measurements of depolymerizing MTs under the absence of Ase1 \pref{ase2b}{C, mid panel}, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments \pref{ase2FRAP}{A} and tracking of single Ase1 molecules diffusing on isolated MTs \pref{ase2FRAP}{B}. Importantly, in the model, only one Ase1 molecule can be attached to any one tubulin heterodimer, and Ase1 can thus only hop to unoccupied neighboring sites. We also assume that Ase1 does not fall off from the MT by hopping at its plus ends, as shown experimentally \parencite{Braun2011}. MT depolymerization is modelled stochastically by detachment of the terminal subunit, at a rate that is affected by Ase1 \pref{ase1d}{B}. Specifically, this rate is $k_d^0$ when the first tubulin subunit is free of Ase1, and $k_d=(1-\Omega)k_d^0$, if Ase1 is bound at the terminal site. The value of $k_d^0$ is set by the MT depolymerization velocity in the absence of Ase1, measured experimentally \pref{ase2t1}{}. The parameter $\Omega\in[0,1]$ specifies the effect of Ase1 on depolymerization. If $\Omega=0$, Ase1 has no effect, while if $\Omega=1$, the terminal subunit cannot unbind if Ase1 is bound. For any value $\Omega>0$, this simple model leads to an exponentially-declining accumulation of Ase1 near the depolymerizing end \pref{ase2d}{C}. The accumulation occurs because subunits without Ase1 are more likely to be lost at the plus end, so depolymerization increases the density of Ase1 at the depolymerizing end. At steady state, the system can be characterized by the probability $P_1$ of the terminal site to be occupied, and the rate of subunits loss is $k_d=k_d^0 (1-\Omega P_1)$.\par

All parameters of this model (Model 1) were set from experimental measurements except for $\Omega$. Therefore, we tested whether any value of $\Omega$ could quantitatively recapitulate the experimental behavior of isolated MTs. We chose to focus on the 6nM Ase1 condition, as the case of antiparallel MTs is structurally more complex (see Discussion), and as our mean field approach may not be suitable for the low Ase1 densities we observed for isolated MTs at the 1nM Ase1 condition. Specifically, we aimed to reproduce the timescale of accumulation of Ase1, and the total amount of Ase1 accumulated and depolymerizing velocity reached at steady state \pref{ase2t2}{}. For $\Omega=0.95$, the model predicted depolymerization velocities comparable to the ones observed experimentally \pref{ase1d}{G, right panel}, but the timescale and number of Ase1 molecules accumulated at steady state were respectively two and three times higher than experimentally observed \pref{ase1d}{F, right panel}. Therefore, despite recapitulating the experimental phenomenology qualitatively \pref{ase1d}{D, right panel}, this first model was insufficient to quantitatively reproduce our experimental results.\par

The failure of Model 1 indicated that Ase1 should affect MT depolymerization at lower density. We thus hypothesized that Ase1 molecules located at lattice sites other than the terminal one could affect depolymerization.\footnote{This hypothesis, and the preliminary modeling of it, were my main contribution to the modeling part of our publication.} Therefore, we tested the possibility that the rate of tubulin subunits loss at the plus end would be reduced by a factor $(1-\Omega)$ if any of the N terminal sites were occupied. This rate at steady state would then be $k_d=k_0^d [1-\Omega{1-\prod_{i=1}^{i=N}(1-P_i)}]$, where $P_i$ is the probability of site i being occupied by Ase1. N is not experimentally constrained, but the range of possible values is small, since it is unlikely that distant tubulin subunits could affect the detachment of the terminal subunit. For $N=3$ and $\Omega=0.9$ this model (Model 2) recapitulated the dynamics of the system \pref{ase2d}{F,G, right panels} and reproduced MT depolymerization velocity and Ase1 accumulation at steady state and Ase1 accumulation timescale \pref{ase2steady}{}. The model predicts that at steady state Ase1 density should decay exponentially from the plus end with a length scale of around 600nm \pref{ase2d}{C}. Experimentally, we observed a decay of Ase1 signal from the plus end with length scale of around 200 nm \pref{ase2e}{A}. \par

        (A) Values of depolymerization velocity and Ase1 accumulation at steady state derived from experiments (blue dot) or predicted by Model 1 and 2 (lines). Experimental values were derived from the depolymerization events shown in Figure 3, and the error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals calculated using the bootstrap method (see \aref{ase2t2}{} and Methods). The lines represent all the solutions of each model from $\Omega = 0$ to $\Omega = 1$, with $N = 3$ for Model 2. Black squares mark the parameter values of $\Omega$ that best fit the experimental data: Model 1 with $\Omega = 0.95$ and Model 2 with $\Omega = 0.9$ for isolated MTs (assuming 13 PFs), and Model 1 with $\Omega = 0.85$ and Model 2 with $\Omega = 0.8$ for antiparallel overlaps (assuming 3 crosslinking PFs). PF = Protofilament. (B) Same as A, with accumulation timescale in the x axis.

Using Model 2 with the same value of $\Omega=0.9$, we could recapitulate the Ase1 accumulation timescale and steady state accumulation in isolated MTs with 1nM of Ase1 \pref{ase2d}{F}, but the model predicted a ~15\% decrease with respect to the maximum velocity while the experimentally observed decrease was between 35\% and 50\% (\aref{ase2d}{G}, \aref{ase2t2}{}). The reason for this disagreement is likely the low density of Ase1 molecules at 1nM concentration (<1\% of tubulin dimers bound to Ase1 in the body of isolated MTs vs. ~12\% at 6nM of Ase1). At this very low density, the stochasticity of the system may not be well captured by our mean field approach (see Methods). The model also fails to reproduce the behavior of antiparallel overlaps (\aref{ase2d}{E,G left panel}, \aref{ase2steady}{left panels}). In the Discussion, I bring forward potential explanations for the discrepancies we observed. \clearpage
