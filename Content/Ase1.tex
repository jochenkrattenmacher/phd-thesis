    (A) Kymographs of an antiparallel (left panel) and a parallel microtubule overlap forming due to the microtubules polymerizing such to enable bundling by Ase1, which is present in solution (42nM). The scale bars are 5 micron and 10 minutes. In sketches, dynamic extensions with GDP lattices are red, and stabilized GMPCPP seeds are blue. The teal bars next to kymographs indicate the presence of regions of overlap (we only counted regions where the two partaking microtubule regions are constituted by GDP-tubulin, i.e., a seed stabilized by GMPCPP did not count). The orange lines indicate a termination of the overlapping period, as evaluated for \autoref{ase1b}A. (B) Same representation as A showing events from experiments performed at 420nM Ase1. (C) Snapshots of different events than shown in A and B, illustrating microtubule bundling (at 42nM). (D) Bundling probability for situations when microtubule plus ends encountered other microtubules, in either parallel or antiparallel orientation, versus the initial angle of interaction (results pooled for all Ase1-mNeonGreen concentrations). The outer numbers denote the numbers of recorded crossings at the respective angle, while the inner numbers denote the numbers of bundling events (the sum of both numbers is the total number of observed events).

To investigate the interaction dynamics between diffusible microtubule crosslinkers and microtubules, we employed total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and interference reflection microscopy (IRM) (\autoref{sec:microscopy}) time-lapse imaging of immobilized, GMPCPP-stabilized microtubule seeds in the presence of 30 µM free tubulin and varying concentrations of Ase1 (\autoref{methods}). At concentrations of 42 nM and 420 nM Ase1, we observed dynamic, Ase1-decorated microtubule extensions polymerizing from the microtubule seeds \pref{ase1a}{A,B}. When two microtubule plus ends, emanating from different seeds and polymerizing towards each other, encountered each other, the microtubules either bundled or crossed, depending on the angle of incidence. Typically, at high angles, the microtubules crossed and only interacted at the crossing point, while at small angles, either parallel or antiparallel associations could be formed \pref{ase1a}{C}. As previously reported \parencite{Janson2007}, antiparallel bundles formed even at large initial angles of incidence (up to 40°), while parallel bundles only formed at initial angles below 20° \pref{ase1a}{D}.\par

Quantitative analysis revealed increased lifetimes of antiparallel overlaps compared to parallel ones\pref{ase1b}{A} Notably, at 42 nM Ase1 in solution, the Ase1 density on antiparallel overlaps was an order of magnitude higher than on parallel ones\pref{ase1b}{B} consistent with the previously reported differential affinities \parencite{Janson2007}. At 420 nM Ase1, we observed the density of Ase1 to be similar on antiparallel and parallel bundles, roughly twice the density found on isolated microtubules\pref{ase1b}{B} This possibly indicated that, at this high concentration, a similar number of Ase1 molecules was present within parallel and antiparallel overlaps. Note, however, that this value represents the total density of Ase1 at the bundle, which might differ from the density of Ase1 molecules directly engaged in MT crosslinking by being bound simultaneously to both microtubules. Despite similar decoration levels by Ase1, antiparallel overlaps were still significantly more stable than parallel ones\pref{ase1b}{A} Given the low polymerization velocity of minus ends, we very rarely observed antiparallel overlaps formed by two minus ends encountering each other, and we thus could not meaningfully quantify the associated lifetime. Generally, we chose to not analyze minus ends given that they are not dynamic \textit{in vivo} \parencite{dammer}.\par

To test whether the relative stability of antiparallel overlaps was caused by Ase1 crosslinking or the bundling itself (as was requested by a reviewer), we also conducted experiments at 10nM Ase1. At this concentration, we observed significantly less Ase1 within antiparallel bundles \pref{ase1c}{A}, and indeed, antiparallel bundles were no more stable than parallel bundles \pref{ase1c}{B}. Also, at 10nM Ase1 we observed antiparallel microtubules to no longer bundle as readily as at higher Ase1 concentrations \pref{ase1c}{C}. While we could detect an Ase1 signal at antiparallel overlaps, we did observe events where Ase1 crosslinking apparently was not strong enough to keep a MT plus end bundled to the MT along which it was growing in an antiparallel orientation \pref{ase1c}{D,E left panel}. Finally, to test whether microtubule bundling in our assays was partially a result of molecular crowding (and not Ase1), we performed an assay at 0nM Ase1. In absence of Ase1, microtubules never bundled, even when very close to each other over extended periods of time, indicating that molecular crowding did not play a role in the microtubule bundling we observed \pref{ase1c}{F}. \par

The relative stability of antiparallel overlaps at high Ase1 concentrations may at least partly owe to the fact that antiparallel overlaps grow with twice the speed of parallel overlaps (since both microtubules polymerize in opposite directions, however it should be noted that once a minus end has been surpassed the antiparallel overlaps does no longer grow as quickly on the side in question); hence, there is more opportunities for rescues to occur during depolymerization. However, our kymographs suggested that antiparallel overlaps may be additionally stabilized by an increase in rescue frequency \pref{ase1d}{A}, and we set out to quantify this issue next. \par

Indeed, as indicated by the kymographs shown in \pref{ase1d}{A}, we found rescue frequencies to be increased for antiparallelly crosslinked microtubules at the Ase1 concentrations where we had observed increased lifetimes of these overlaps \pref{ase1d}{B}. To test whether Ase1 crosslinking might have other significant effects on MT polymerization, we next quantified the other three parameters of microtubule dynamic instability. We found that catastrophe frequencies were similar across the tested conditions, with no statistically significant difference between the different populations \pref{ase1d}{C}. Polymerization velocities were similar for all microtubule types, either isolated or bundled, across all tested Ase1 concentrations as well \pref{ase1d}{D}. However, at 420nM Ase1, MTs depolymerized markedly slower than at lower Ase1 concentrations. Further, at 42nM and 420nM Ase1, antiparallel MTs displayed a marked decrease in depolymerization velocity compared to isolated and parallel MTs \pref{ase1d}{E}. Thus, we observed Ase1 to only have a measurable effect on MT depolymerization, by reducing the rate of depolymerization and increasing chances for rescue, with no effect on polymerization.\par

If one only considers our results at 42nM, one could speculate that the particularly pronounced stabilization of antiparallel microtubules was due to the increased number of Ase1 molecules on antiparallel MTs as compared to parallel and isolated MTs. However, at 420nM, the number of Ase1 molecules per MT was similar across all types of MTs, while the antiparallel MTs still were more stable, despite indistinguishable Ase1 densities on antiparallel versus parallel MT overlaps \pref{ase1d}{F,G}. Thus, Ase1 engaged in antiparallel crosslinking seems to have a stronger effect on MT depolymerization than Ase1 engaged in parallel crosslinking or Ase1 not engaged in crosslinking. This deduction is supported by the fact that the number of Ase1 molecules engaged in Ase1 crosslinking was the only factor we could identify as influencing the frequency of rescues (note, however, that the number of molecules directly participating in the crosslinking process, i.e. simultaneously bound to both crosslinked microtubules, is not measurable in this assay). TODO RESULTS FOR THE OTHER ASSAY Altogether, these results show that Ase1 can differently modulate MT dynamics in parallel and antiparallel overlaps, with a high specificity for stabilizing antiparallel MT bundles.

    (A) Representative kymograph traces of the types of events we observed in our dataset which we present in \autoref{ase1a} and \autoref{ase1b}. Blue arrows indicate rescue events. Dotted lines indicate stretches where the MT was isolated. (B) Rescue frequency, (C) catastrophe frequency, (D) polymerization velocity, and (E) depolymerization velocity of dynamic MT plus ends in different configurations and in the presence of varying concentrations of Ase1-mNeonGreen. (F) Depolymerization velocity (see E) versus Ase1-mNeonGreen density on a given MT or bundle divided by number of MTs in that bundle (i.e., the density as shown in \autoref{ase1b}B is divided by 2 in the case of parallel and antiparallel MTs).  (G) Rescue frequency (see B) versus Ase1-mNeonGreen density (see \autoref{ase1b}B). All plots show results for the same experiments as shown in \autoref{ase1a} and \autoref{ase1b}. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001 (Tukey's test; only significance levels are visualized that share either the same MT type or the same concentration. No visual link between two populations sharing one such characteristic signifies  p>0.05. In B and C a given population comprises the frequencies recorded for the respective experiments, in D and E the velocities recorded for respective sampled periods). Boxplots are weighted by the length of a sampled period of polymerization or depolymerization. In boxplots, the numbers indicate the number of recorded events, in bar plots, the numbers indicate the sum of the length of all sampled periods of polymerization or depolymerization (in minutes). In bar plots, the height of the bar indicates the catastrophe/rescue frequency as determined from all time lapses (number of total events divided by total duration of depolymerization), while the error bars indicate the lowest and highest rates as determined from each isolated time lapse; velocities are normalized to the median velocity of isolated MTs (Methods).
