In conclusion, our study reveals that tau exists in two kinetically distinct phases on microtubules, forming cohesive islands through cooperative binding.
In summary, our simple model shows that the necessary assumption that Ase1 prevents depolymerization at plus ends is sufficient to explain sweeping at shrinking microtubule ends without further assumptions. Subunits without Ase1 are more likely to be lost at the plus-end, so depolymerization increases the density of Ase1 at the depolymerizing end. The model recapitulated quantitatively the behaviour of the system for 6nM of Ase1, and within an order of magnitude for 1nM of Ase1. However, a more complicated model may be required to explain the behaviour of MT overlaps.
