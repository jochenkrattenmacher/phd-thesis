TODO explanation and author contributions.
This publication can be found in appendix A.
\section{Publication 2: Ase1 selectively increases the lifetime of antiparallel microtubule overlaps}
The results of this work are presented in \autoref{sec:Ase1} and have been published in Current Biology \parencite{Krattenmacher2024}. Unless indicated otherwise, the experiments and the analysis have been conducted exclusively by me. The most notable contribution by a third party was by Manuel Lera Ramirez, who had contributed 85 \% of the model-related work (most of the remaining model-related work was performed by me, i.e., work as indicated in the text).
