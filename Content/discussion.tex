\section{The patterning of cytoskeletal polymers}
Can we draw any insights which go beyond the pecuilarities of each of the two MAPs I was focusing on? It has already been mentioned
- If tubulin bonds were strong laterally, then the cell would have to break up two strong bonds in order to initiate dissassembly -> Maybe would be too complicated, which is why such stabilization does not really take place a lot?
- On the importance of interplay and cooperation?
