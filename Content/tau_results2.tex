\textbf{Tau islands constitute a protective envelope around microtubules.} (A) Fluorescence micrographs showing katanin-driven (green, example indicated by green arrow) disassembly of Atto-647-microtubules (blue) decorated with tau islands (red, example indicated by red arrow) interspersed by regions of low tau-mEGFP density (indicated by blue arrow). An example region outside an island is indicated by white arrow. An example of an island-covered region being slowly shortened by katanin is indicated by a yellow arrow. (B) Fluorescence micrographs showing katanin-driven (green) disassembly of Atto-647-microtubules (blue) decorated with tau islands (red) formed at 0.8 µM tau concentration. The island positions (indicated by numbers) were determined via a brief removal of tau from solution. The green arrow shows an example region outside of islands and its decoration with katanin, the red arrow shows an island-covered region (katanin was absent from such regions). An example of rapid disassembly of surrounding regions is indicated by the white arrow. Compare to A. (C,D) Boxplots of the velocities of katanin-driven disassembly of stretches of microtubules covered by tau islands (evaluated per island boundary) and the rate of katanin-generated cuts occurring within them, at the two different tested tau concentrations. (E) Exemplary time-traces of normalized tubulin signal outside the island-covered microtubule regions (blue line) decaying during its katanin-driven disassembly. Single exponential fits to the data (black lines) yield a tubulin residence time of 17 ± 6.4 s (average ± S.D., n = 17 microtubules in 2 experiments) in presence of 20 nM tau and 34 ± 23 s (n = 18 microtubules in 2 experiments) in presence of 800 nM tau. Photo-bleaching during this experiment was negligible (Methods).

To investigate how tau islands interact with other microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), we formed tau islands and tested the interaction of other axonal MAPs with such tau-decorated microtubules. Among others, we tested the microtubule-transport motor kinesin-1, where we found that while these motors could move freely through surrounding regions, they were totally blocked from accessing island-decorated microtubule regions. However, these experiments were exclusively performed and analzed by my colleague Valerie Siahaan, thus the results for these experiments (see \cite{Siahaan2019a}) are not shown in this thesis. As mentioned in \aref{chap:publications}{}, I contributed to our results regarding the cutting enzyme katanin and was exclusively conducting and analyzing experiments regarding the motor protein kinesin-8.\par

After the addition of 100nM (GFP-labeled) katanin to microtubules in the presence of 20nM (mCherry-labeled) tau, we observed katanin binding almost exclusively to the low-density tau regions surrounding the islands \pref{taukatanin}{A, 15s panel}. As one may expect from this observation, we then subsequently observed microtubule disassembly predominantly in these regions \pref{taukatanin}{A, 30s panel}. Only on longer time scales, the island-covered regions of the microtubules started to disassemble from their boundaries, with occassional cuts occuring inside tau islands \pref{taukatanin}{A-C}. Combined, these results show that tau islands constitute a protective envelope around the microtubule surface, which can hinder the activity of microtubule-severing factors and block kinesin-1-based transport. \par

As shown in the previous section, higher tau concentrations, the tau densities inside and outside tau islands are comparable \pref{tauflushouts}{A}. We thus wondered if the discretely binding tau molecules in the island surroundings, at these concentrations, are sufficient for shielding the microtubule against microtubule severing. We thus formed tau islands at saturating conditions (0.8 µM). After 5 minutes of incubation we briefly removed tau from solution to note the position of the islands, and then again re-introduced 0.8 µM tau in the assay. We then exposed such tau decorated microtubules to 0.2 µM katanin analogously to the experiment presented in \aref{taukatanin}{A}. Strikingly, we observed qualitatively identical results as in \aref{taukatanin}{A}. Namely, regions surrounding the islands and occupied by the diffusible tau phase were severed and rapidly disassembled, while microtubule regions shielded by the islands persisted \pref{taukatanin}{D}. This demonstrates that the density of tau on the microtubule surface is not the factor determining the shielding function of tau. Rather it is the unique nature of the cooperative tau binding mode which protects the microtubules. This conclusion is supported by our observation that increasing the tau concentration in solution did not substantially increase shielding against tau, neither in the island regions \pref{taukatanin}{B,C} nor in their surroundings \pref{taukatanin}{E}.\par

The red arrows indicate an accumulation of Kip3 in front of an island, disassembling it. The white arrows indicate an instance where Kip3 molecules can clearly been observed to speed up as they leave the island.

Kinesin-8, in contrast to kinesin-1, is a super-processive motor \pref{sec:kip3}{}, which led us to hypothesize that its interaction with tau islands might differ from the behavior by kinesin-1. For our experiments, we used S. cerevisiae Kip3, the best described member of the kinesin-8 family \pref{sec:kip3}{}. After the addition of 45nM (GFP-labeled) Kip3 to microtubules in the presence of 20nM or 100nM (mCherry-labeled) tau, we observed that Kip3 molecules could move in the low-density tau regions, like kinesin-1 \pref{taukip3}{A,B}. However, in contrast to kinesin-1, and presumably related to its characteristic of super-processivity, Kip3 could also traverse tau islands, albeit at a decreased velocity \pref{taukip3}{A-C}. Similarly, we also observed Kip3 to be less prevalent in regions covered by tau islands, indicating a lower affinity for these regions \pref{taukip3}{A,D}. We also observed the previously described \pref{sec:kip3}{} traffic jams at the end of microtubules \pref{taukip3}{A,B}. Interestingly however, we also observed that Kip3 accumulated, in the direction of its movement, at the boundaries of tau islands \pref{taukip3}{A,B}. Such Kip3 traffic jams evidently caused enhanced unbinding of tau at these positions, eventually leading to a disassembly of the islands from their boundaries with a velocity slightly lower than the velocity of Kip3 within islands \pref{taukip3}{B,C,E,F}. The island displacement by Kip3 shows that not only do tau islands regulate the interaction of other MAPs with the microtubule surface but that, vice versa, the activity of other MAPs, such as super-processive motors proteins, can regulate the dynamics of the islands themselves.

\subsection{Tau islands do not form at regions of high microtubule curvature}

\textbf{Tau islands do not form at regions of high microtubule curvature.} (A) Fluorescence micrograph showing the tau signal on microtubules at 20 nM tau in solution. (B) Kymograph showing the uniform increase of tau density along the whole region of the microtubule curve upon the addition of tau in solution. (C) Exemplary
time-trace of tau density in the regions of high curvature after addition of 20 nM tau-mEGFP in solution (n = 5 microtubules, thick line
and shaded area indicate the three quartiles). (D) Densities of tau outside the islands, inside the islands and in the regions of high curvature at 20 nM tau in solution (n = 11 high-curvature regions in 5 experiments). Points are color-coded by experiments, horizontal lines indicate the three quartiles, weighted such that each experiment has equal weight. (E) Densities of tau-mCherry
outside the islands, inside the islands and in the regions of high curvature (after the removal of 0.8 µM tau from solution). Points are
color-coded by experiments (n = 15 high-curvature regions in 4 experiments), horizontal lines indicate the three quartiles, weighted
such that each experiment has equal weight. (F) Tau density profile along the microtubule after removing 800 nM tau from solution. X-axis is centered on the point of highest curvature. Data are color-coded by microtubule and the density is normalized to the 90th percentile of the density-values of the respective microtubule. The red line represents the median of n = 30 microtubules (7 experiments), the first and third quartile are indicated by the shaded area. At 800 nM tau, there always were islands adjacent to microtubule bends, which is why the tau density to the left and right of the curved microtubule region is high even though tau has been removed from solution. A clear decrease in the tau density is apparent at the point of highest curvature. (G) Tau islands on microtubules after the removal of 800 nM tau from solution (upper panel); the same microtubule in presence of re-introduced 800 nM tau in solution (middle panel); the same microtubule in presence of 200 nM katanin and 800 nM tau. The red arrow highlights that the high curvature region  had been cut by katanin. (H) Probability of severing of highly curved microtubule regions and adjacent straight island-covered microtubule regions, within 150 s after the addition of katanin. The bars represent the probability averaged over n = 4 experiments (29 bends and 82 straight microtubules), error bars represent the S.D. Curved microtubule regions were always cut.

Earlier reports show that tau preferentially localized to highly-curved microtubules\parencite{Samsonov2004}. We indeed observed that regions of highly curved microtubules (radius < 2.5 µm) exhibited a tau density that was higher than in the surroundings, but lower than in the islands on straight microtubule regions (Figure \ref{tau7}A,B). The tau bound to highly curved microtubule regions also did not unbind as quickly as in the surroundings (Figure \ref{tau7}D, \ref{tau_s7}A,B). Importantly however, the highly curved regions were not protected from katanin-mediated severing (Figure \ref{tau7}C,D), demonstrating that tau molecules in the highly curved regions do not form a cohesive layer. Accordingly, in the curved regions tau-mEGFP binding was distinct from the island formation on straight microtubules, in that there was no growth at boundaries (Figure \ref{tau_s7}C). Combined, these experiments suggest that high curvatures of microtubules, though attracting tau, prevent the formation of cohesive tau islands.
