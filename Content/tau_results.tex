To study the interaction of tau with microtubules, we immobilized Atto-647-labeled microtubules on a coverslip, added full-length tau (fluorescently-labeled with the proteins mEGFP or mCherry) and performed time-lapse imaging using TIRF microscopy (Methods). Conspicuously, after the addition of 20 nM tau, we observed a formation of high-density tau islands, surrounded by regions with low tau density \pref{tauGROW}{A-C}.

These islands, after nucleating from diffraction-limited spots, grew along along a given microtubule to cover more and more of its length \pref{tauGROW}{C,D}. After 75 minutes, most of the microtubule length in a given field of view was covered with islands, with islands still continuing to grow \pref{tauGROW}{E}. When repeating this experiment with higher tau concentrations of 40 and 90nM, microtubules were covered more quickly \pref{tauGROW}{F}, due to a higher nucleation rate of islands \pref{tauGROW}{G} as well as due to faster and more consistent growth at island boundaries \pref{tauGROW}{H}. \par

Generally, the islands did not grow monotonously at their boundaries, but with variable velocities in the order of 25 nm/s, corresponding to about 10 molecules added per second \pref{tauGROW}{H}. Importantly, the tau density in the islands stayed constant during the period of growth \pref{tauGROW}{I}, suggesting that the islands grow by the addition of tau molecules at their boundaries, reminiscent of epitaxial growth of thin films. As another indication that islands are formed by a well-defined tau layer occupying the entire accessible surface of the microtubule, we never observed an increase in the tau density when the boundaries of neighboring growing islands came into contact \pref{tauGROW}{C}.\par

When tau was removed from solution, the islands disassembled slowly from their boundaries, occassionally fissioning inside \pref{tauSHRINK}{A-B}. In contrast to island growth, this island shrinkage rarely halted \pref{tauSHRINK}{B}, and proceeded with a median velocity of approximately 2 tau molecules unbinding per second at a given island boundary \pref{tauSHRINK}{C}. Importantly, the tau density within islands only declined very slowly after removing tau from solution compared to the decline in tau density on all regions outside of islands (the “island surroundings”) \pref{tauSHRINK}{D}. Indeed, while in the surroundings tau unbound with a time constant of about 2 seconds as inferred from the decay of the fluorescence signal \pref{tauSHRINK}{E}, within the islands tau molecules unbound on the timescale of tens of minutes \pref{tauSHRINK}{F}. This extremely low unbinding rate explains the preservation of the islands in absence of tau in solution and suggests that the occasional island fissions observed during disassembly occur after rare events of tau molecules unbinding from inside the island. The large difference in the tau unbinding rates within islands compared to island surroundings, together with the assembly and disassembly kinetics at the island boundaries, indicate that tau molecules in the islands bind to microtubules cooperatively.

To more thoroughly explore whether and how the phenomena we observed were concentration-dependent, we conducted additional experiments, increasing the range of tested tau concentrations. Our observations revealed that island formation did not occur below a critical tau concentration of approximately 5 nM (n = 245 microtubules in 5 experiments; these experiments were performed by my colleague Valerie Siahaan). Above this threshold, we noted that the tau density both within and outside the islands increased with the tau concentration in solution \pref{tauflushouts}{A}. We had noticed this previously already with our experiments at 20, 40 and 90nM tau, yet with much larger concentrations it in addition became apparent that tau binding to microtubules in our buffer condition reaches a saturation point at around 1000nM \pref{tauflushouts}{A}. Moreover,under such saturated binding conditions, the density on the microtubule appears to be uniform \pref{tauflushouts}{A}, i.e., a distinction between islands and surroundings based on tau density can no longer be made. However, upon removing tau from solution, in areas surrounding the islands, the tau density rapidly returned to background levels within seconds \pref{tauflushouts}{B-E}, consistent with our previous surrounding-related findings when removing 20nM Ase1 \pref{tauSHRINK}{E}. Meanwhile, the islands persisted \pref{tauflushouts}{B-C} as observed previously \pref{tauSHRINK}{A}. However, at higher Ase1 concentrations it became apparent that the tau density within the islands exhibits a two-phase decay upon removal of tau: an initial rapid, uniform decrease along the entire island length, followed by a slower density reduction \pref{tauflushouts}{E}. Importantly, the tau density within the islands, following the rapid density drop, consistently measured 0.26 ± 0.05 tau molecules per tubulin dimer (average ± SD, n = 101 microtubules, 14 experiments, Methods). This value remained constant regardless of the initial tau concentration in solution \pref{tauflushouts}{F}. \par

Combining these results with our findings from \aref{tauGROW}{} and \aref{tauSHRINK}{}, we conclude that cohesive islands on microtubules form through the cooperative binding of tau molecules, resulting in their slow unbinding. At physiological tau concentrations \parencite{Wegmann}, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 µM, we observed the co-localization of rapidly turning over tau molecules with the islands. The density of these co-localized tau molecules, which appears to correlate with the tau concentration in solution similarly to the tau density outside the islands \pref{tauflushouts}{G}, does not seem to be part of the cooperative island formation process. \par

To further explore the dynamics of tau molecules in the islands, we formed islands using 20 nM tau-mCherry and, after 15 minutes, replaced the assay buffer by a solution containing 20 nM tau-mEGFP. Outside the islands, tau-mCherry was replaced quickly by tau-mEGFP \pref{tauexchange}{A}. This included the growth of new islands, which now proceeded by addition of tau-mEGFP \pref{tauexchange}{A}. However, within the islands, tau-mCherry visibly remained bound to microtubules for longer \pref{tauexchange}{A,B}. We quantified this effect by fitting the tau density in a given region at different time points to an exponential decay function \pref{tauexchange}{C}: In the low-density regions, surrounding the islands, tau-mCherry dissociated from the microtubules with an average residence time of about 3 seconds \pref{tauexchange}{D}, a value comparable to the residence time where tau was completely removed from solution without replacement \pref{tauSHRINK}{E}. By contrast, within the islands tau-mCherry dissociated markedly slower, with an average residence time of 20 ± 7 s (average ± SD) seconds \pref{tauexchange}{E}. This value is, however, substantially faster than in the situation when tau was completely removed from solution, in which case the dwell time was 45 ± 46 min (compare to \aref{tauSHRINK}{F}). Thus, we observed that tau unbinding from the islands depends on the tau concentration in solution. As another piece of evidence confirming this dependence, we observed that tau-mCherry unbound form islands even faster when adding 100nM tau-mEGFP as compared to the addition of 20nM tau-mEGFP (in this case, the dwell time was 6.4 ± 2.1 s) \pref{tauexchange}{E}.\par

To further study the spatio-temporal interaction dynamics of tau and microtubules, we formed islands using a mixture of 20 nM tau-mCherry and 1 nM tau-mEGFP. This strategy allowed us to observe the motion of individual tau-mEGFP molecules even within tau islands,

\noindent as these islands were mainly comprised of tau-mCherry molecules. In the low-density regions, single tau-mEGFP molecules diffused rapidly \pref{tausingle}{A}. By contrast, in the islands the tau-mEGFP molecules did not display any noticable movement \pref{tausingle}{A}. Quantifying these phenomena (Methods), we measured that outside the islands, tau molecules diffused with a diffusion constant of 0.27 ± 0.15 $\mu m^2s^{-1}$ (95\% confidence bounds) \pref{tausingle}{B}, comparable to values reported before by \cite{Hinrichs2012b}. Within the islands, we measured tau-mEGFP molecules to have a diffusion constant of 0.027 ± 0.016 $\mu m^2s^{-1}$ \pref{tausingle}{B}. To test whether we indeed observed single tau molecules rather than conglomerates which had formed in solution, we generated fluorescence intensity histogram of individual tau-mEGFP particles \pref{tausingle}{C}. These exhibited a single Gaussian profile in the islands just as in their surroundings, indicating that tau-tau interactions indeed occurred only on the microtubule lattice. We also formed islands using a mixture of 100 nM tau-mCherry and 1 nM tau-mEGFP. Consistent with the results shown in \aref{tauflushouts}{}, we observed diffusive and/or brief interactions of tau molecules inside islands \pref{tausingle}{D}. It also beas noting that occasionally, single tau-mEGFP molecules initially diffusing outside an island became stationary when associating with an island boundary \pref{tausingle}{A}, hinting at growth of the islands from the boundary.\par

\end{figure}

Finally, we were interested in exploring some plausible determinants of island assembly beside tau concentration. First, because the N-terminus of tau mediates tau-tau interactions \parencite{Gamblin2003}, we attempted to grow tau islands with a truncated tau construct comprising the four-repeat microtubule-binding domain and the C-terminus but lacking the N-terminus (tau$\Delta$N-mEGFP, \aref{tauconstructs}{}). Although tau$\Delta$N-mEGFP did interact with the microtubules, we did not observe any island formation even at 0.5 µM tau$\Delta$N-mEGFP (these experiments were performed by my colleague Valerie Siahaan). Second, we varied the ionic strength of our buffer solution by varying the concentration of KCl (these experiments were largely performed by me; for reasons of space we did not include these findings in \cite{Siahaan2019a}). We noticed that increasing as well as decreasing the concentration of KCl from the level we had used for the experiments we have reported on so far, namely 75mM, both tended to decrease the stability of tau islands: 0, 25, 100, and 125nM KCl islands disassembled quicker once tau was removed from solution than at 75mM KCl \pref{tausalt}{A,B}. Disassembly speed was drastically higher at 200mM KCl \pref{tausalt}{A right panel}. Generally, tau binding to the microtubule was less pronounced at higher KCl concentrations, both in terms of island formation and binding to surrounding regions (data not shown). However, interestingly, at 0 and 25mM KCl, island assembly was more pronounced than at 75mM KCl \pref{tausalt}{C}. At the same time, at these low KCl concentrations, more tau bound to the microtubule via the diffusive binding mode, visible from the high tau densities in the surrounding regions \pref{tausalt}{D}. Consistent with the observation that islands at lower ionic strengths were less stable, when looking at single tau-mEGFP molecules in a tau-mCherry-dominated environment, we observed that the distinction between binding within the islands versus binding outside the islands was less clear-cut than at 75mM KCl \pref{tausalt}{E}. Tau molecules appeared to switch regularly between diffusive and stationary interactions within islands, though the diffusive interactions appeared more tightly bound to the microtubule than outside the islands \pref{tausalt}{E}. We had observed such switches already at 75mM KCl, though at that condition these switches were much less prevalent \pref{tausingle}{D}.\par

Combined, our results show that tau molecules bind to microtubules in two distinct binding modes. The diffusive binding mode had already been described before \parencite{Hinrichs2012b}. However, we together with \cite{tan2019microtubules} discovered another, cooperative, binding mode, which results in the formation of what we termed tau islands (in more recent publications on the topic the term "envelopes" is used, see e.g. \cite{siahaan2022microtubule}). This cooperative binding mode, unlike the diffusive mode, is dependent on the N-terminus region of tau. The strength of this cooperative binding mode moreover varies differently with ionic strength than the strength of the diffusive binding mode.
