To study microtubule-associated tau molecules, we immobilized Atto-647-labeled microtubules on a coverslip, added full-length, human 2N4R (tau441) tau fluorescently labeled on the C-terminus (tau-mEGFP or tau-mCherry) and performed time-lapse imaging using TIRF microscopy (Methods). After the addition of 20 nM tau we observed on the microtubules the formation of high-density tau islands, surrounded by regions with low tau density \pref{tauGROW}{A-C}. These islands, after nucleating from diffraction-limited spots, grew along along a given microtubule to cover more and more of its length \pref{tauGROW}{C,D}. After 75 minutes, most of the microtubule length in a given field of view was covered with islands, with islands still continuing to grow \pref{tauGROW}{E}. When repeating this experiment with higher tau concentrations of 40 and 90nM, microtubules were covered more quickly \pref{tauGROW}{F}, due to a higher nucleation rate of islands \pref{tauGROW}{G} as well as due to faster and more consistent growth at island boundaries \pref{tauGROW}{H}.

Generally, the islands did not grow monotonously at their boundaries, but with variable velocities in the order of 25 nm/s, corresponding to about 10 molecules added per second \pref{tauGROW}{H}.  Importantly, the tau density in the islands stayed constant during the period of growth \pref{tauGROW}{I}, suggesting that the islands grow by the addition of tau molecules at their boundaries, reminiscent of epitaxial growth of thin films. As another indication that islands are formed by a well-defined tau layer occupying the entire accessible surface of the microtubule, we never observed an increase in the tau density when the boundaries of neighboring growing islands came into contact \pref{tauGROW}{C}.\par

When tau was removed from solution, the islands disassembled slowly from their boundaries, occassionally fissioning inside \pref{tauSHRINK}{A-B}. In contrast to island growth, this island shrinkage rarely halted \pref{tauSHRINK}{B}, and proceeded with a median velocity of approximately 2 tau molecules unbinding per second at a given island boundary \pref{tauSHRINK}{C}. Importantly, the tau density within islands only declined very slowly after removing tau from solution compared to the decline in tau density on all regions outside of islands (the “island surroundings”) \pref{tauSHRINK}{D}. Indeed, while in the surroundings tau unbound with a time constant of about 2 seconds as inferred from the decay of the fluorescence signal \pref{tauSHRINK}{E}, within the islands tau molecules unbound on the timescale of tens of minutes \pref{tauSHRINK}{F}. This extremely low unbinding rate explains the preservation of the islands in absence of tau in solution and suggests that the occasional island fissions observed during disassembly occur after rare events of tau molecules unbinding from inside the island. The large difference in the tau unbinding rates within islands compared to island surroundings, together with the assembly and disassembly kinetics at the island boundaries, indicate that tau molecules in the islands bind to microtubules cooperatively.

To more thoroughly explore whether and how the phenomena we observed were concentration-dependent, we conducted additional experiments, increasing the range of tested tau concentrations. Our observations revealed that island formation did not occur below a critical tau concentration of approximately 5 nM (n = 245 microtubules in 5 experiments). Above this threshold, we noted that the tau density both within and outside the islands increased with the tau concentration in solution \pref{tauflushouts}{A}. We had noticed this previously already with our experiments at 20, 40 and 90nM tau, yet with much larger concentrations it in addition became apparent that tau binding to microtubules in our buffer condition reaches a saturation point at around 1000nM \pref{tauflushouts}{A}. Moreover,under such saturated binding conditions, the density on the microtubule appears to be uniform \pref{tauflushouts}{A}, i.e., a distinction between islands and surroundings based on tau density can no longer be made. However, upon removing tau from solution, in areas surrounding the islands, the tau density rapidly returned to background levels within seconds \pref{tauflushouts}{B-E}, consistent with our previous surrounding-related findings when removing 20nM Ase1 \pref{tauSHRINK}{E}. Meanwhile, the islands persisted \pref{tauflushouts}{B-C} as observed previously \pref{tauSHRINK}{A}. However, at higher Ase1 concentrations it became apparent that the tau density within the islands exhibits a two-phase decay upon removal of tau: an initial rapid, uniform decrease along the entire island length, followed by a slower density reduction \pref{tauflushouts}{E}. Importantly, the tau density within the islands, following the rapid density drop, consistently measured 0.26 ± 0.05 tau molecules per tubulin dimer (average ± SD, n = 101 microtubules, 14 experiments, Methods). This value remained constant regardless of the initial tau concentration in solution \pref{tauflushouts}{F}. \par

Combining these results with our findings from \aref{tauGROW}{} and \aref{tauSHRINK}{}, we conclude that cohesive islands on microtubules form through the cooperative binding of tau molecules, resulting in their slow unbinding. At physiological tau concentrations \parencite{Wegmann}, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 µM, we observed the co-localization of rapidly turning over tau molecules with the islands. The density of these co-localized tau molecules, which appears to correlate with the tau concentration in solution similarly to the tau density outside the islands \pref{tauflushouts}{G}, does not seem to be part of the cooperative island formation process. \par

	\textbf{Tau molecules in the islands exchange with tau in solution.} (A) Multichannel kymograph showing an island pre-formed in presence of 20 nM tau-mCherry (red). After the addition (time marked by white asterisk) of 20 nM tau-mEGFP (green), removing most of the tau-mCherry from solution, tau-mEGFP replaces tau-mCherry inside and outside of the islands. An example of an island resuming its growth by the addition of tau-mEGFP is marked by an orange arrow, a nucleation event is marked by a white arrow. (B) Exemplary time-trace of normalized tau-mCherry and tau-mEGFP density inside and outside the islands after exchange of 20 nM tau-mCherry for 20 nM tau-mEGFP. Photo-bleaching during this experiment was negligible (Methods); the dotted line indicates that the sample was out of focus at the time. (D) The dwell time of fluorescently labeled tau in the islands decreases with increasing concentration of tau in solution (at 0 nM tau, dwell time was 45 ± 46 min, at 20 nM tau, the dwell time was 20 ± 7 s, for 100 nM tau, the dwell time was 6.4 ± 2.1 s, average ± SD). The inset displays the 20 nM and 100 nM boxes on a magnified y-scale. Data points are color-coded by experiments. Typical time-traces and corresponding fits underlying these data are shown in Figure S1G and S2B,S2C.

To further explore the dynamics of tau molecules in the islands, we formed islands using 20 nM tau-mCherry and, after 15 minutes, replaced the assay buffer by a solution containing 20 nM tau-mEGFP. Outside the islands, tau-mCherry was replaced quickly by tau-mEGFP \pref{tauexchange}{A}. This included the growth of new islands, which now proceeded by addition of tau-mEGFP \pref{tauexchange}{A}. However, within the islands, tau-mCherry visibly remained bound to microtubules for longer \pref{tauexchange}{A,B}. We quantified this effect by fitting the tau density in a given region at different time points to an exponential decay function \pref{tauexchange}{C}: In the low-density regions, surrounding the islands, tau-mCherry dissociated from the microtubules with an average residence time of about 3 seconds \pref{tauexchange}{D}, a value comparable to the residence time where tau was completely removed from solution without replacement \pref{tauSHRINK}{E}. By contrast, within the islands tau-mCherry dissociated markedly slower, with an average residence time of 20  seconds \pref{tauexchange}{E}. This value is, however, substantially faster than in the situation when tau was completely removed from solution (compare to \aref{tauSHRINK}{F}). Thus, we observed that tau unbinding from the islands depends on the tau concentration in solution. As another piece of evidence confirming this dependence, we observed that tau-mCherry unbound form islands even faster when adding 100nM tau-mEGFP as compared to the addition of 20nM tau-mEGFP \pref{tauexchange}{E}.\par

To further study the spatio-temporal interaction dynamics of tau and microtubules, we formed islands using a mixture of 20 nM tau-mCherry and 1 nM tau-mEGFP. This strategy allowed us to observe the motion of individual tau-mEGFP molecules even within tau islands, as these islands were mainly comprised of tau-mCherry molecules. In the low-density regions, single tau-mEGFP molecules diffused rapidly \pref{tausingle}{A}. By contrast, in the islands the tau-mEGFP molecules did not display any noticable movement \pref{tausingle}{A}. Occasionally, single tau-mEGFP molecules initially diffusing outside an island became stationary when associating with an island boundary \pref{tausingle}{A}. Quantifying these phenomena (Methods), we measured that outside the islands, tau molecules diffused with a diffusion constant of around 0.27 $\mu m^2s^{-1}$ \pref{tausingle}{B}, comparable to values reported before by \cite{Hinrichs2012b}. Within the islands, we measured tau-mEGFP molecules to have a diffusion constant of around 0.027 $\mu m^2s^{-1}$ \pref{tausingle}{B}. To test whether we indeed observed single tau molecules rather than conglomerates which had formed in solution, we generated fluorescence intensity histogram of individual tau-mEGFP particles \pref{tausingle}{C}. These exhibited a single Gaussian profile in the islands just as in their surroundings, indicating that tau-tau interactions indeed occurred only on the microtubule lattice (Figure S2E). \par

Finally, because the N-terminus of tau mediates tau-tau interactions \parencite{Gamblin2003}, we attempted to grow tau islands with a truncated tau construct comprising the four-repeat microtubule-binding domain and the C-terminus but lacking the N-terminus (tau$\Delta$N-mEGFP, \aref{tauconstructs}{}). Although tau$\Delta$N-mEGFP did interact with the microtubules, we did not observe any island formation even at 0.5 µM tau$\Delta$N-mEGFP.\par

Combined, our results show that tau molecules bind to microtubules in two distinct binding modes. The diffusive binding mode had already been described before \parencite{Hinrichs2012b}. However, we together with \cite{tan2019microtubules} discovered another, cooperative, binding mode, which results in the formation of what we termed tau islands (in more recent publications on the topic the term "envelopes" is used, see e.g. \cite{siahaan2022microtubule}). This cooperative binding mode, unlike the diffusive mode, is dependent on the N-terminus region of tau.

\optional{To test the robustness of the island assembly using the full-length construct, we varied the ionic strength of the assay buffer and observed the islands to assemble over a broad range of conditions (0 - 125 mM KCl additional in the assay buffer).}
